# github-pipeline — Product Requirements (v2)

Product truth for the **github-pipeline** Claude Code plugin, authored as the baseline for the v2
rewrite: it states the behavior the rewrite must preserve (derived from v1) and the requirements it
adds. Authoritative-but-mutable; changes route through the normal conflict gate. *What* and *why*
live here; *how* lives in [architecture.md](architecture.md); the migration itself in
[implementation.md](implementation.md).

## §1 Product overview & goals

github-pipeline turns GitHub issue delivery into a conveyor of operator-driven Claude Code
sessions — **draft → research → slice → plan → resolve → evaluate** — plus standalone maintenance tools.
Its outcomes:

- Every unit of work is captured as a well-formed, reviewed GitHub issue before code is written.
- Implementation happens against a verified, citable plan pinned to the code it was planned on.
- Every change lands on a write-protected `main` through a PR that has been health-checked and
  judged against the issue's Definition of done.
- The human operator decides at every consequential gate — and only there.

v2 goals, with the operator workflow preserved exactly: (1) every deterministic step is script
work, not model work; (2) the prompt surface is reduced to judgment and contracts; (3) a
session's loaded instructions contain no other type's flow — a router plus one playbook (§9.4);
(4) the deterministic layer is testable offline.

## §2 Personas & terminology

- **Operator** — the single human who starts each session, answers gates, and approves persists
  and merges. Exactly one; see §3 non-goals.
- **Consuming repo** — the GitHub repository the pipeline works on. Any tech stack. Provides
  configuration via marker blocks in its `CLAUDE.md`/`COMMANDS.md`. Its `main` is write-protected:
  every change lands via PR.
- **Skills** — fixed names. Pipeline stages: `drafter`, `researcher`, `slicer`, `planner`,
  `resolver`, `evaluator`. Standalone tools: `setup`, `question-sweep`, `question-resolver`, `doc-reviewer`,
  `requirements-gatherer`, `workspace-open`, `workspace-close`. Invoked as `/github-pipeline:<name>`.
- **Session** — one Claude Code run of one skill. **Handoff** — the summary + copy-pasteable
  next-command block a pipeline session emits on clean exit; the only bridge between sessions.
- **Gate** — an explicit decision question put to the operator.
- **Router / playbook** — a skill's always-loaded routing prompt (the router) and the single
  on-demand flow document (the playbook) a session executes.
- **Currency** — whether recorded knowledge still matches the present state of the world (docs
  vs code, plan vs code, external facts vs today).
- **Workspace** — a git worktree under the consuming repo's `.worktrees/`. Two kinds: a **work
  workspace** (branch checkout, where changes are made — opened by the operator with
  `workspace-open`, the session started inside it, released with `workspace-close`) and a
  **read workspace** (a pinned, read-only checkout, script-internal grounding plumbing).
- **Question registry** — the set of `question`-labelled issues; the registry of record for open
  questions (docs are sources, never the registry).

## §3 Scope

**In scope for v2:** all nine skills (v3 adds the two workspace tools, making eleven, the slicer, making twelve, and the requirements-gatherer, making thirteen), the bundled scripts, the shared cross-skill contracts, the
plugin manifests, and offline tests for the deterministic layer.

**Out of scope / non-goals:**

- No new pipeline stages, no reordering or merging of stages.
- No schema changes to persisted GitHub artifacts (§7); v1-written artifacts must remain readable
  by v2 and vice versa on the same issues and PRs.
- No autonomous chaining: a skill never starts another skill's session or crosses the session
  boundary itself; re-routes are carried by the handoff for the operator to run.
- No multi-operator concurrency features beyond what git and GitHub natively enforce.
- No stack-specific behavior in skills; stack knowledge lives only in consuming-repo
  configuration and gated integrations.
- Not a general-purpose GitHub client: a skill performs only the operations its stage requires.

## §4 Pipeline workflow requirements

- **§4.1 Session-per-stage.** Each pipeline stage runs in its own session with fresh context.
  Cross-session state travels only through GitHub artifacts (§7) and the handoff.
- **§4.2 Handoff.** On clean exit a pipeline skill emits a `## Handoff` per the shared handoff
  schema: cold-readable state using the closed-set state markers, plus the exact next command.
  A re-route to a prior stage carries a `Why:` line stating the evidence for the regression.
- **§4.3 Gates only for genuine decisions.** The operator is asked when a choice changes the
  outcome (scope, deviation, merge, destructive action) — never to confirm a fact a tool can
  derive. A mechanical blocker (auth failure, ambiguous state, dirty root) is presented as a
  single decision card with concrete options.
- **§4.4 Faithful reporting.** Sessions lead with the outcome; failures are reported verbatim
  with their evidence; skipped work is declared, not implied done.

## §5 Pipeline stage requirements

Operator-visible behavior each stage must provide. The detailed v1 behavior inventories that
ground these are produced by implementation step S1. Lettered items are individually citable
(e.g. §5.4(b)).

- **§5.1 drafter.**
  - (a) Captures informal feedback as a filed, template-conformant issue.
  - (b) Classifies bug / incomplete / feature / epic / question, asking only when signals
    genuinely conflict.
  - (c) Grounds framing in the consuming repo's PRD, surfacing contradicts / extends / gap
    tensions as a `## PRD impact` note and conflict gate.
  - (d) Runs an adversarial draft review before filing.
  - (e) *(Retired at #16 — see §5.6.)* The drafter drafts and revises **one** issue's body, an Epic's
    included, and decomposes nothing: splitting an epic into story issues is the slicer's, at epic
    altitude. The letter is kept rather than renumbered because §5.x letters are cited individually.
    (Its original wording — "with the epic body linking them" — was already superseded by the native
    parent/sub-issue relation at 3.1.0, which retired the `## Stories` checklist on a fresh epic.)
  - (f) Never silently absorbs an unresolved open question from a source doc: each is matched
    against the question registry (search before file), filed if untracked, and recorded on the
    build issue per disposition — `scoped-out`, `in-scope (blocked)` (with a native `blocked by`
    dependency), or `provisional-default`.
  - (g) Revise mode updates an existing issue while preserving its plan pointer.
  - (h) Nothing is filed or edited without operator confirmation.
- **§5.2 researcher.**
  - (a) Currency-driven external research: declines when no currency risk exists; otherwise
    derives research questions (broad mode) or answers the given ones (targeted mode).
  - (b) Produces a dossier comment with tiered, dated sources, validated by an isolated review
    before persisting.
  - (c) The dossier is input-not-authority: implications and tensions, never settled decisions.
  - (d) Revise mode refreshes an existing dossier — re-fetching moved sources, re-dating claims,
    answering newly posed questions — and replaces the prior comment.
- **§5.3 planner.**
  - (a) Produces a reviewed implementation plan as a durable issue comment, grounded on an
    explicitly recorded commit SHA (§8.4), citing docs by stable anchor and code by precedent.
  - (b) Locks its decisions and gates genuine tradeoffs to the operator.
  - (c) Declines to plan a change that requires no design decision (a single obvious edit with
    no alternatives worth recording).
  - (d) Epic plans pin cross-story contracts and stay immutable; story plans are authored
    just-in-time against the epic's current state, including what prior stories actually
    delivered.
  - (e) Revise mode reconciles the existing plan against thread, PR, and DoD state.
  - (f) Never resolves an open question itself.
  - (g) Before recording any open question as unfiled it searches the question registry; a
    tracked question is always cited by its issue number.
  - (h) Handoffs render the open-questions line in every session shape, including combined
    epic + story sessions.
- **§5.4 resolver.**
  - (a) Implements exactly one issue per session against its verified plan.
  - (b) Before building: audits fitness (including plan-vs-code currency) and hard-refuses an
    issue whose open questions leave it `in-scope (blocked)` with the blocking question still
    open.
  - (c) Builds only in the work workspace the session was started in, verified at session
    start (§8.3); refuses on a mismatched, stale, or root-seated checkout.
  - (d) Projects Definition-of-done ticks with annotations as phases ship.
  - (e) Loops with code review until approved.
  - (f) Multi-phase issues ship one phase per PR, tracked in a `## Phase tracker` section of the
    PR body (§7).
  - (g) Comment-only outcomes are supported without code changes.
  - (h) When the plan does not survive contact with the code, re-routes to the planner or
    drafter with the evidence.
  - (i) On an epic target it ships no code — it carries the integration branch's lifecycle, and
    opens the integration PR **early, as a draft**, as soon as that branch is ahead of the default
    branch: the operator gets a reviewable view of overall epic progress from the first landed
    story rather than only after the last one closes. The PR's body is refreshed on each epic run;
    the review loop and the draft→ready flip happen once, when the story set closes and the epic's
    Definition of done is verifiable. Draft state is what keeps a mid-flight epic out of the
    evaluator (§5.5, which refuses a draft PR).
- **§5.5 evaluator.**
  - (a) The verdict-and-merge authority.
  - (b) Runs the health gate (CI plus the consuming repo's configured checks), caching the
    result per head SHA in the `<!-- pr-evaluator-health-cache:v1 -->` comment (§7).
  - (c) Verifies DoD ticks against their annotations, un-ticking with a sticky veto on mismatch.
  - (d) Judges scope match, doc grounding, and plan adherence.
  - (e) Issues APPROVE or COMMENT review actions and never approves its own PR.
  - (f) Merges per the configured per-PR-type policy (default `ask`) and the strategy rules for
    the PR's shape.
  - (g) On story merge: closes the story and appends the epic delivery log. Closing the story is
    what advances the epic's progress — GitHub recomputes the sub-issue rollup from issue state
    ([`skills/_shared/epic-story-hierarchy.md`](../skills/_shared/epic-story-hierarchy.md)); only a legacy epic still carrying a
    `## Stories` checklist also needs its checkbox ticked.
  - (h) Leaves the work workspace in place after merge and hands the operator the
    `workspace-close` command (the one reclamation path — merged, abandoned, or mis-opened).
- **§5.6 slicer.** Appended after §5.5 rather than inserted at its conceptual position: §5.x numbers
  are cited individually elsewhere (e.g. §5.4(b), §5.5(f)), so renumbering would dangle those
  references. The conceptual order is drafter → researcher → **slicer** → planner.
  - (a) Cuts ONE filed issue into ordered, operator-approved children and files them as native
    sub-issues via the single write path, in approved order (creation order is display order —
    sub-issues append). **One operation at two altitudes** (#16), differing in exactly one parameter —
    the independence bar, set by whether the child gets its own branch and PR: a story or standalone
    issue cuts into **deliverable slices** (*demonstrable*), an epic cuts into **stories**
    (*shippable*). The bar is stated once, in the method reference; the flow reads it as
    `vector.altitude` rather than forking.
  - (b) Reachable two ways: operator invocation, and a planner re-route when the seam gate's shape
    triage finds the issue too large to plan as one unit — with *demonstrable*-independent seams it
    cuts slices, and with *shippable*-independent seams it promotes the issue to an Epic and cuts
    stories (both of the gate's off-ramps land here since #16). It hands back to the planner, whose
    phases then map onto the slices (`sub-issue:`).
  - (b2) **Promotion.** On the epic-shaped off-ramp it rewrites the target's body as an Epic, rewrites
    its title to carry the `Epic:` prefix (classification is lexical, so a promotion that skipped the
    title would leave the target reading as a non-epic), and swaps
    its type label, behind its **own** explicit diff-and-confirm gate ahead of the cut's write gate —
    a body rewrite is destructive where a `create` is not. Declining leaves the target untouched.
  - (b3) **Epic over existing issues.** Adopts already-filed issues as an epic's children through the
    single write path (`gh_persist.py add-parent`, the one after-the-fact parenting write), reporting
    each candidate's live state — and never silently moving an issue out of another parent.
  - (b4) **Adversarially reviewed before the operator sees it.** A context-blind cut reviewer (§8)
    holds the ordering and sizing judgment for both altitudes, including the bookend-slot check at
    epic altitude; findings resolve under a pass cap and a circular guard. This is the judgment that
    previously lived as dimensions 5 and 7 of the drafter's issue reviewer.
  - (c) **Grounding gate.** Refuses to decompose without adequate grounding, and every slice cites
    what it derives from. Grounding sources are the consuming repo's own declaration (the
    `<!-- doc-catalogue -->` block, §7) or sources the operator names at invocation — never
    plugin-side paths. A slice that can cite nothing is surfaced, never filed.
  - (d) **Write gate.** Zero GitHub mutations before one explicit confirmation of the full cut (§8.2).
    A partial failure after the gate reports exactly what landed and never claims completion.
  - (e) **Resume, don't duplicate.** Re-running against a partially-sliced issue detects the existing
    slices and cuts only the remainder.
  - (f) The **cut** never edits the parent issue's body. Child detail lives only in child bodies; no
    `## Slices` section is written. Exactly two parent-body writes are sanctioned, each behind its own
    explicit gate and never as a side effect of filing: the promotion rewrite (b2), and reconciling a
    legacy `## Stories` checklist on an epic that has no native relation for those entries.
  - (g) Refuses, with a reason, on a target that is itself a slice (**never slice a slice**), is a
    `question`, is closed, or is blocked by an open native blocker or an `in-scope (blocked)` open
    question read from live state. An **epic is not refused** since #16 — it is the epic-altitude
    happy path.
  - (h) Slices are **phase markers**, not sub-stories: the resolver ships each as a phase on the
    parent's branch and closes it as its last serving phase lands, so the parent's rollup is a live
    progress record ([`skills/_shared/epic-story-hierarchy.md`](../skills/_shared/epic-story-hierarchy.md)).
    The evaluator is a merge-time backstop only.

## §6 Standalone tool requirements

All seven run only on explicit invocation and end with a plain summary — not a pipeline handoff.
The five report-then-apply tools change nothing without the operator seeing the proposal;
tracked-file edits follow §8.2: staged in a workspace, with the landing offered as a final gate
(the requirements-gatherer, §6.7, edits no tracked files — its one write surface is a gated
issue-body edit). The two workspace tools (§6.5/§6.6) edit no tracked files either — their
action is the workspace lifecycle itself, and the explicit invocation is the authorization.

- **§6.1 setup.** Proposes and reconciles the consuming repo's configuration blocks: inventories
  existing blocks, drafts grounded candidates from repo evidence, interviews the operator for
  what can't be inferred, and validates what it wrote.
- **§6.2 question-sweep.** Reconciles the open questions found across the consuming repo's docs
  against the question registry: files untracked questions, repairs doc↔issue links in both
  directions, flags stale doc state, and reports orphans.
- **§6.3 question-resolver.** Assisted closing of one question issue: grounds the constraints and
  decision space in the pinned docs, records the operator's decision as a durable marker comment,
  optionally closes the issue, and proposes — never applies — the doc fold-back. The operator
  decides; the skill records.
- **§6.4 doc-reviewer.** Reviews a single project doc against its bundled authoring guide and
  offers to apply accepted findings.
- **§6.5 workspace-open.** Opens the work workspace for an issue: adopts or creates the issue's
  GitHub-linked branch (the native "create a branch for this issue"; degrades to a local branch
  with a notice where linking is unsupported), owns epic integration-branch creation, creates or
  reuses the worktree under `.worktrees/`, runs the repo's worktree-setup hooks, and tells the
  operator where to start the next session. A foreign open/draft PR gates before any side
  effect. Never plans or resolves anything itself.
- **§6.6 workspace-close.** Releases a work workspace (branch name or issue number): runs the
  worktree-teardown hooks, then removes the worktree — gated on dirty/unpushed state (never a
  silent discard; merged-PR-aware so the routine post-merge close isn't false-flagged), and
  refused from inside the target worktree. Removes worktrees, never remote branches.
- **§6.7 requirements-gatherer.** Interactive requirement elicitation for one filed issue:
  suggests grounding documents from the repo's doc catalogue (the operator confirms, adds, or
  drops), elicits an enumerated requirement set in discussion with the operator (iterating on a
  human-readable draft until approved), and appends the approved requirements to the issue's
  `## Definition of done` as plain unticked criterion bullets — each citing its source document
  by durable anchor, or provenanced as operator-elicited when no document records it. Detail is
  never duplicated from a doc into the issue; downstream stages read the cited sections. It
  authors no documents, files no issues, and refuses epics, slices, question issues, and closed
  issues. (Appended after §6.6 rather than inserted at its conceptual position — §6.x numbers are
  cited individually elsewhere, so renumbering would dangle those references.)

## §7 Persisted artifacts (the compatibility contract)

The rewrite must not change the schema or semantics of any artifact below. **Falsifiable form:**
an artifact written by a v1 skill is consumed correctly by its v2 counterpart, and vice versa.

| Artifact | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| `<!-- implementation-plan:v1 -->` plan comment | issue comment |
| `<!-- issue-research:v1 -->` dossier comment | issue comment |
| `<!-- epic-delivery-log:v1 -->` delivery log | epic issue comment |
| Native parent/sub-issue relation (epic↔story hierarchy) | GitHub issue relation |
| `<!-- question-decision:v1 -->` recorded decision | question issue comment |
| `<!-- open-question-links:v1 -->` section + closed disposition set | build-issue body |
| Definition-of-done checkbox annotations (closed set) | issue body |
| `<!-- pr-evaluator-health-cache:v1 -->` health-cache comment | PR comment |
| `## Phase tracker` section (multi-phase issues) | PR body |
| `question`-issue body schema + `audience:*` labels | question issues |
| `## Handoff` schema + closed-set state markers | session output |
| Config marker blocks (`issue-resolver-*`, `pr-evaluator-*`, `drafter-open-question-markers`, `worktree-setup`/`-teardown`, `claude-code-stack-profile`) | consuming repo `CLAUDE.md`/`COMMANDS.md` |
| `<!-- doc-catalogue -->` grounding-doc declaration (setup-written, planner/drafter-read) | consuming repo `docs/README.md` |
| Deliverable-slice sub-issue body + `<parent#>/S<K>` title convention (slicer-written) | slice issues |
| `epic/<N>-<slug>` integration-branch naming | consuming repo branches |

## §8 Grounding & workspace requirements

- **§8.1 `main` is write-protected.** No skill commits to a checkout other than its own
  session's workspace; the landing tools treat the checkout they were started in as read-only;
  every change reaches `main` through a PR.
- **§8.2 Everything lands via PR; landing is operator-gated.** All tracked-file changes a skill
  produces — code, docs, and configuration blocks — are made in a workspace on a branch, never
  in the root, and reach `main` only through a PR, gated per change or by a standing
  per-PR-type merge policy the operator configured (§5.5(f), default `ask`). The resolver opens
  its PR as part of its flow. The standalone tools that edit tracked files (`setup`,
  `question-sweep`, `doc-reviewer`) stage approved edits in the workspace and **offer** the
  landing (commit + push + PR) as one explicit final gate: on decline they perform no git
  actions, and the summary reports the workspace path and the ready-to-run landing commands.
- **§8.3 Workspaces.** A building or evaluating session runs **inside** the work worktree the
  operator opened (`workspace-open`) and starts the session in; its prep asserts that checkout
  before judgment runs and reports it as the session's workspace. Gate config and worktree hooks
  are read from that checkout's working tree, committed or not, and each read reports its source;
  pinned-ref grounding views are script-internal.
- **§8.4 Pinned grounding.** Plans, audits, and evaluations ground on an explicitly recorded
  commit SHA, and their artifacts state it.
- **§8.5 Checkout state is respected.** A mismatched, stale, or root-seated session checkout is
  surfaced as a decision gate (`WORKSPACE_MISMATCH`), never auto-corrected. The operator's own
  checkout is otherwise left alone: no path gates on its branch or dirty state, and none writes to
  it.

## §9 Engineering-quality requirements

- **§9.1 Deterministic/judgment split.** Any step whose inputs and correct output are fully
  defined (fetching, parsing, state derivation, ref selection, naming, command execution) is
  performed by scripts. Model reasoning is reserved for classification, drafting, planning,
  review, and verdicts. No intermediary agent relays between a skill and its scripts; skills
  invoke scripts directly.
- **§9.2 One-shot state assembly.** A session that needs starting state obtains all of it from
  a single script invocation; no session assembles state across multiple model-mediated calls.
- **§9.3 Offline testability.** The deterministic layer runs and is tested without network
  access or a live GitHub repo.
- **§9.4 Prompt economy.** A session loads only its router plus the one playbook it is
  executing; alternative playbooks stay on disk.
- **§9.5 Behavior parity.** A rewritten skill replaces its predecessor only after passing the
  parity protocol defined in [implementation.md](implementation.md).
- **§9.6 Portability.** The deterministic layer behaves identically on macOS (BSD userland) and
  Linux (GNU userland); no skill step depends on platform-specific tooling.

## §10 Success metrics

- Prompt text a pipeline session loads (router + the one playbook) is at most half of the v1
  `SKILL.md` line count for that skill (v1 baseline recorded by implementation step S1). A stage with
  **no v1 baseline** (the `slicer`) records a **measured** bar instead, derived from the closest real
  precedent with its derivation written beside the constant — halving does not apply, since there is no
  monolith to halve. Per the S19 doc-reviewer ruling, an honest implementation that exceeds a recorded
  bar is adjudicated and re-recorded; precision is never trimmed out of a prompt to hit a number.
- Session startup performs at most one state-assembly invocation — exactly one for the pipeline
  stages (§9.2).
- The contract-token census (S1 baseline) shows zero unintended losses after each skill cutover.
- The offline suite exercises every script decision code and passes on both macOS and Linux.
- All nine skills pass the parity protocol before v1 removal.

## §11 Constraints & assumptions

- One operator per consuming repo at a time; concurrent sessions share only git/GitHub-enforced
  state.
- `gh` is installed and authenticated with repo scope; `git` and Python 3 are present (versions
  pinned in [architecture.md §1](architecture.md)). The skills require no other runtimes,
  interpreters, or packages.
- Consuming repos may lack optional capabilities (native issue dependencies, grounding docs,
  config blocks); skills degrade gracefully and say so.
- The plugin install directory is read-only at runtime; nothing is ever written there.
