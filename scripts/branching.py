"""branching.py — shared branch-naming, type-detection, and prior-PR classification cores.

Import-only module (no shebang, no ``main`` — like ``oq_tracker.py`` it is composed in-process by
the preps, never dispatched). Extracted verbatim from ``prep_resolver.py`` at the v3
workspace-model inversion so that ``prep_workspace_open.py`` (which now owns branch creation) and
``prep_resolver.py`` (which now only *asserts* the ambient branch) derive branch names, issue
types, epic-branch discovery, and prior-PR rows from ONE implementation. ``prep_resolver.py``
keeps module-level aliases to every extracted name (the ``build_oq_query = oq_tracker.build_oq_query``
precedent in ``prep_planner.py``), so its public surface — and the direct-call tests against it —
are unchanged.

Everything here is a pure derivation over ``git ls-remote`` / ``gh`` list queries: no worktree
side effects, no GitHub writes. The behavioral contracts (the 7-row prior-PR table, the 6-step
fresh-slug derivation, `-vN` collision suffixing, epic-branch discovery) are specified in
``docs/specs/resolver.md`` and were not altered by the extraction.

       (:func:`branch_belongs_to_issue` — `<N>-<slug>`, `-vN`-suffixed, or `epic/<N>-<slug>`), or
    2. it CLOSES the issue — `closes_issue`, derived by
       `gh_gather._filter_and_strip_reference_fields` from GitHub's own `closingIssuesReferences`
       link set.

    Both arms are required. Head-name alone would regress every branch this pipeline ADOPTED but
    did not name — a `gh issue develop` linked branch taken verbatim (`prep_workspace_open.py`
    adopts "whatever this run would have named"), a hand-named branch, a fork branch — from
    `continue` to `fresh`, minting a duplicate branch and a duplicate PR over live work.
    Closes-link alone would miss a PR opened before its closing keyword was written, and degrades
    to nothing on a `gh` build that returns no `closingIssuesReferences`. Neither arm scans body
    text: a `#<N>` in a body is exactly the mention signal this function exists to reject.

    The rejected case is the one it was written for: an epic integration PR carries `Fixes #<epic>`
    and lists every story by number, so the `#<N> in:body` search surfaces it once per story — and
    adopting it made a story classify `continue` onto the shared `epic/<N>-<slug>` branch, silently
    demoting the story to a deliverable slice (`skills/_shared/epic-story-hierarchy.md`:
    own-branch-and-PR is the ONE parameter separating the two). Its head belongs to the epic and
    its close link names the epic, so both arms reject it for the story while both still accept it
    for the epic itself — this is issue-scoped, not a blanket exclusion of epic PRs.

    Known residual, accepted: a PR that genuinely IS this issue's but sits on a branch neither
    pipeline-named nor close-linked (an external contributor's fork branch with no closing keyword)
    now reads as `fresh`. Every PR this pipeline opens carries `Fixes #<N>`, and workspace-open's
    linked-branch rung adopts before minting, so pipeline-created PRs always satisfy an arm; the
    residual is strictly narrower than the epic-story breakage this closes.
