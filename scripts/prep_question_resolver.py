"""prep_question_resolver.py — the question-resolver skill's complete starting-state facts block in one
call (architecture.md §4; docs/implementation.md S18; docs/specs/question-resolver.md).

The **question-resolver** is the assisted-closing path for ONE open `question`-type issue: it grounds
the question against the docs, helps the operator reach a decision, records that decision durably as a
`<!-- question-decision:v1 -->` comment, offers to close the issue, and PROPOSES (never applies) the doc
fold-back. This prep assembles the session's entire deterministic starting state — the target question +
thread + the decision-marker **reentrancy** signal, the not-a-question guard, the native **`blocking`**
list (the build issues this question gates — the reverse edge that fills the decision comment's
`## Unblocks`), `root.sha`, and `attention` — as ONE JSON envelope on stdout, so the resolver session's
startup is one Python process, never a subprocess chain.

Composition (architecture.md §2 "compose the executors in-process"; §1 "the only external processes any
script may spawn are git/gh"; S8 pattern lock)::

    gh_gather.run(..., marker_prefix=<decision>)  -- the question body/thread + the
                                                     `<!-- question-decision:v1 -->` decision-marker
                                                     envelope (one round-trip; the marker via
                                                     `marker_prefix`). A marker present -> revise mode;
                                                     its `id` is what the flow's `gh_persist.py comment
                                                     --delete-marker-id` deletes on the replace.
    git rev-parse HEAD                            -- root's own SHA (informational; no freshness gate in
                                                     prep — the resolver writes no tracked files)

`gh_gather.run` exposes the S8-locked emit-through-a-stream shape; this prep passes a discard stream and
reads the returned ``(exit, envelope)`` directly, forwarding any ``needs_decision`` verbatim (see the
reentrancy note) and emitting exactly one envelope of its own. No ``redirect_stdout``/``io.StringIO``
capture of another script's stdout is used anywhere (S9-on rule; docs/specs/baseline.md §5).

**Reentrancy (docs/specs/question-resolver.md "Invariants": revise, never duplicate).** The decision
marker's count drives the mode — the skill is reentrant, a re-run must revise, not duplicate:

  - ``marker_comment_count == 0`` -> ``mode: "fresh"`` — no prior decision.
  - ``marker_comment_count == 1`` -> ``mode: "revise"`` — a prior decision exists; its `comment_id` is
    staged so the flow's `gh_persist.py comment --delete-marker-id` REPLACES (post-new-then-delete-old,
    gh_persist's built-in) rather than stacking a second decision comment.
  - ``marker_comment_count > 1`` -> the gather's ``MARKER_AMBIGUOUS`` `needs_decision` (v1's
    "DECISION_NEEDED: which decision is current"), forwarded verbatim — prep emits it and stops.

**Already-closed** (`state == CLOSED`) is a fact, not a gate: a re-run revises the comment in place and
`gh_persist.py close` on an already-closed issue is a `gh` no-op (safe for a reentrant caller); the flow
offers `reopen` only when a materially-changed decision needs the issue visible again (§7).

**Not a `question` issue** (`question` label absent) is a fact (`is_question: false` + an `attention`
line), not a `needs_decision` — the router stops and points at the `resolver`, matching v1's
"stop and say so" and the same "facts by script, decision by router" posture prep_setup uses for a
malformed block.

**Native `blocking` list** — the build issues this question gates (the reverse edge, from `gh_gather`'s
`blocking`): surfaced so the decision comment's `## Unblocks` and the Step-9 summary breadcrumb name
them. `blocked_by` rides along informationally.

**No workspace, no root-freshness gate in prep** (the root-only shape prep_researcher/prep_setup adopted):
the resolver writes no tracked files — its two write surfaces are the decision comment and an offered
close, and the doc fold-back is proposal-only (docs/specs/question-resolver.md "Invariants"). `root.sha`
is a plain informational `git rev-parse HEAD` (the docs are read at the working tree — a question isn't
tied to a branch).

Usage::

    prep_question_resolver.py <issue> <owner/repo> [--root PATH] [--scratch-dir PATH] [--cwd PATH]

``<issue>`` is the one question-issue number (required). ``--root`` defaults to ``.`` (architecture.md
§6's read-only trust vantage). ``--scratch-dir`` defaults to ``/tmp/gh-question-resolver-<issue>``
(CLAUDE.md's ``/tmp/gh-<skill>-<N>/`` convention) — where the flow later stages `decision.md`.

Exit codes (architecture.md §3): 0 with the facts-block envelope present (``status`` is ``"ok"`` or
``"needs_decision"``); 2 on a usage error (no envelope). Any other non-zero is an unclassified hard
`gh`/`git` failure surfaced by the composed gather — stderr carries the faithful error.
