"""prep_question_sweep.py — the question-sweep skill's complete starting-state facts block in one call
(architecture.md §4, §9.2; docs/implementation.md S18; docs/specs/question-sweep.md).

The **question-sweep** reconciles the open questions (OQs) scattered across a repo's docs against the
GitHub **question registry** — the set of `question`-labelled issues, the registry of record
(`skills/_shared/open-question-links.md` §"Status is the tracker's"). This prep assembles the session's
entire deterministic starting state — the registry snapshot **with the Tier-1 status join per entry**,
the doc-candidate detection inputs (the `<!-- drafter-open-question-markers -->` config block + the doc
inventory in scope), `root.sha`, staging, and `attention` — as ONE JSON envelope on stdout, so the
sweep session's startup is one Python process, never a subprocess chain from the router body.

Composition (architecture.md §2 "compose the executors in-process"; §1 "the only external processes
any script may spawn are git/gh"; S8 pattern lock)::

    gh issue list --label question --state all    -- the registry snapshot (a prep-owned direct `gh`
                                                     call — the same precedent every prep establishes
                                                     for a list read `oq_tracker` does not cover: its
                                                     `--search` shape is the de-dup lookup, not a full
                                                     registry enumeration)
    gh_gather.run(..., marker_prefix=<decision>)  -- per still-OPEN question: the decision-marker probe
                                                     that realizes the Tier-1 join's second half, and
                                                     stages the body/thread the router's Tier-2 reader
                                                     reads without a re-fetch
    config_block.read_block_anywhere              -- the `<!-- drafter-open-question-markers -->` OQ
                                                     detection hint (raw interior — meaning is the
                                                     router's read, per prep_drafter's identical use)
    git rev-parse HEAD                            -- root's own SHA (informational; no freshness gate
                                                     in prep — see the "No workspace" note)

No ``redirect_stdout``/``io.StringIO`` capture of another script's stdout is used anywhere (S9-on rule;
docs/specs/baseline.md §5): the composed cores return their payloads directly.

**The Tier-1 status join (the DoD box-1 matrix; `open-question-links.md` §"Status is the tracker's").**
Per registry entry, prep derives a deterministic Tier-1 `status` from two script-visible signals — the
issue `state` and, for an OPEN issue, whether a `<!-- question-decision:v1 -->` comment exists:

  - ``closed``          — the issue is `closed` (Tier-1 resolved; no marker fetch — closed short-
                          circuits, `open-question-links.md` §Status Tier 1).
  - ``decision-marked`` — the issue is `open` but carries a `<!-- question-decision:v1 -->` comment
                          (Tier-1 resolved by the durable decision `question-resolver` records).
  - ``still-open``      — the issue is `open` with no decision marker → ``tier2_needed: true``, the
                          signal that only the ROUTER-dispatched question-status reader (Tier 2,
                          judgment) can tell whether the thread already answered it. **Prep never runs
                          Tier 2** — the reader is a sub-agent the router dispatches (§4a), not a
                          deterministic step.
  - ``ambiguous``       — the issue is `open` and carries MORE than one decision comment (the gather's
                          `MARKER_AMBIGUOUS`): recorded as an `attention` fact + a per-entry status,
                          **not** forwarded as a `needs_decision` — one anomalous question must not
                          abort a project-wide sweep (the router surfaces it; never auto-resolves).

Only OPEN entries cost a marker fetch; a ``closed`` entry is resolved from its `state` alone. So the
call budget is: 1 registry list + one `gh_gather` round-trip (3 `gh` calls) per OPEN question — flat
and script-visible (the two-sided budget test).

**Detection inputs, not detection (facts by script, meaning by model).** Prep surfaces the
`<!-- drafter-open-question-markers -->` config block raw (register-location / inline-pattern / open-
status-rule prose is the router's read) with `heuristics_active` when absent, and a doc inventory of
the files in scope. The grep-prefilter + `Explore`-confirm detection and the doc-OQ↔question matching
stay judgment in the playbook (docs/specs/question-sweep.md "Judgment steps").

**No `suggested_playbook`** — the sweep is a single linear flow (no mode fork), like `setup`.

**No workspace, no root-freshness gate in prep** (the root-only shape `prep_setup`/`prep_researcher`
adopted): the registry read and detection inputs read the read-only `main` vantage; `root.sha` is a
plain informational `git rev-parse HEAD`. The sweep's tracked-file edits (doc fold-backs / back-links)
are staged in a work workspace and land via an operator-gated PR (prd.md §8.2) — that gate lives in the
flow's landing step, where `workspace.py ensure --work` gates root-freshness, not here.

Usage::

    prep_question_sweep.py <owner/repo> [--scope GLOB] [--root PATH] [--scratch-dir PATH] [--cwd PATH]

``<owner/repo>`` is required (the router resolves it via `gh repo view` and passes it, the same way
every pipeline prep receives its repo). ``--scope`` is the operator's optional docs path/glob (the
`[docs-path-or-glob]` sweep argument); it rides in `scope.arg` as a fact and defaults to `docs/**`.
``--root`` defaults to ``.`` (architecture.md §6's read-only trust vantage). ``--scratch-dir`` defaults
to ``/tmp/gh-question-sweep-<repo-basename>`` (CLAUDE.md's ``/tmp/gh-<skill>-<N>/`` convention) — where
each open question's body/thread spills and the flow later stages companion-issue bodies.

Exit codes (architecture.md §3): 0 with the facts-block envelope present (``status`` is ``"ok"`` or
``"needs_decision"``); 2 on a usage error (no envelope). Any other non-zero is an unclassified hard
`gh`/`git` failure surfaced by the composed gather — stderr carries the faithful error.
