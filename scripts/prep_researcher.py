"""prep_researcher.py — the researcher's complete facts block in one call (architecture.md §4;
docs/implementation.md S16; docs/specs/researcher.md). Assembles the session's entire starting
state — the three-way mode vector (broad / targeted / revise), the target issue + thread +
`<!-- issue-research:v1 -->` dossier-marker envelope (the revise signal), the manifest/governing-doc
inventory the currency check reads, `suggested_playbook`, and `attention` — as ONE JSON envelope on
stdout, so the researcher session's startup is one Python process, never a subprocess chain.

Composition (architecture.md §2 "compose the executors in-process"; §1 "the only external
processes any script may spawn are git/gh")::

    gh_gather.run(..., stream=)   -- the target issue's body/thread + the `<!-- issue-research:v1 -->`
                                     dossier-marker envelope (one round-trip; the marker via
                                     `marker_prefix`). A marker present -> revise mode; its `id` is
                                     what the flow's `PERSIST_COMMENT` (via `gh_persist.py comment
                                     --delete-marker-id`) deletes on delete-and-repost.

`gh_gather.run` exposes the S8-locked emit-through-a-stream shape (docs/specs/baseline.md §5); this
prep passes a discard stream and reads the returned ``(exit, envelope)`` directly, forwarding any
``needs_decision`` (``MARKER_AMBIGUOUS`` for a duplicate dossier comment, ``AUTH_REQUIRED``) verbatim
and emitting exactly one envelope of its own. No ``redirect_stdout``/``io.StringIO`` capture of another
script's stdout is used anywhere in this module (S9-on rule; docs/specs/baseline.md §5).

``git rev-parse HEAD`` (root's own SHA, informational only) has no existing executor core —
architecture.md §1 permits any script to spawn `git`/`gh` directly via ``pipelib.process.run``, the
same precedent `prep_drafter.py`/`prep_planner.py`/`prep_resolver.py`/`prep_evaluator.py` already
established for their own prep-owned direct calls.

Usage::

    prep_researcher.py <issue> <owner/repo> [--question TEXT ...] [--root PATH]
                       [--scratch-dir PATH] [--cwd PATH]

``<issue>`` is required — the researcher researches an already-filed issue (docs/specs/researcher.md
"Overview"; it never files one). ``--question`` is the operator-supplied ``— <question>`` from the
targeted trigger (repeatable), and selects targeted vs broad mode (see ``vector.mode`` below); its
text rides in ``vector.questions`` so the playbook has it as a fact. ``--root`` defaults to ``.``
(the project root — architecture.md §6's read-only trust vantage). ``--scratch-dir`` defaults to
``/tmp/gh-researcher-<issue>`` (CLAUDE.md's ``/tmp/gh-<skill>-<N>/`` convention) when omitted — this
is where the flow later stages the dossier body (``research.md``) before persisting; prep itself
stages nothing (no dossier exists yet at session start).

**No workspace — the researcher grounds on the CURRENT checkout, not a pinned ref (S14 root-only
precedent; docs/specs/researcher.md "Overview": "no epic/story branching, no worktree involvement";
SKILL.md:85-93).** v1 discovers the project's stack and governing docs at runtime from wherever the
working tree happens to be (``read whatever the repo actually has``), with no requirement that the
tree be clean or on ``main`` — the manifest inventory is a **currency-check input** for filtering web
research, never a build/merge gate. Unlike the planner/resolver/evaluator (each of which forks a
pinned-ref workspace off a verified-fresh root specifically to gate a build/merge decision —
architecture.md §6's "Gate config is pinned to trust"), the researcher reads no PR head and gates no
merge, so architecture.md §6's threat model ("a PR weakening its own gates") cannot apply. ``root``
therefore carries only ``{path, sha}`` (a plain, non-gating ``git rev-parse HEAD`` — informational,
never enforced) — no ``workspace.py`` import, no ``fresh`` key. Same root-only shape `prep_drafter.py`
adopted (see that module's "No workspace" note), for the same threat-model reason.

**``vector.mode`` — the THREE-value closed set ``"broad"`` / ``"targeted"`` / ``"revise"``**
(docs/specs/researcher.md "Modes"). Derived purely mechanically from two script-visible signals — the
dossier marker's presence and whether the operator supplied a ``--question``:

  - an ``<!-- issue-research:v1 -->`` dossier already exists on the issue -> ``"revise"``
    (SKILL.md:63 "An existing dossier => revise mode" — the dominant trigger; the flow refreshes what
    changed and delete-and-reposts, whether or not a ``--question`` narrows the refresh).
  - no dossier, a ``--question`` supplied -> ``"targeted"`` (SKILL.md:57 — the questions are given,
    typically because the planner hit a specific knowledge gap and routed here; the flow skips
    derivation and the confirm gate).
  - no dossier, no ``--question`` -> ``"broad"`` (SKILL.md:56 — the default first run; the flow
    derives the questions, runs the decline gate, and confirms them before spending fetches).

**``suggested_playbook``** (architecture.md §5 "Prep proposes; the router confirms") maps the mode onto
its thin variant playbook: ``"broad.md"`` / ``"targeted.md"`` / ``"revise.md"``. Each variant supplies
only its distinct front-end (broad derives questions + runs the decline and confirm gates; targeted uses
the given questions; revise reads the prior dossier and refreshes only what changed) and then runs the
shared ``research-spine.md`` (gather -> synthesize -> validate -> persist -> handoff). The split is the
§5-honest one — the three modes differ in genuine front-end/persist **actions** (broad can exit posting
nothing; revise delete-and-reposts and shows a diff), not merely in values — the largest single loaded
file (router + ``research-spine.md``) stays under half the v1 ``SKILL.md`` line count, recorded in
``docs/specs/parity/researcher.md``. The router routing table is byte-consistent with this map.

**Manifest / governing-doc inventory (docs/specs/researcher.md "Deterministic steps"; SKILL.md:89-90).**
A filesystem inventory at ``root`` of whichever dependency manifest and governing-doc files actually
exist — the *inventory* is deterministic; the *reading and synthesizing* into a one-line stack-context
summary stays judgment (the playbook's Step 3). Manifests carry the pinned versions that are "the
single most important signal for is-my-recall-current". The candidate names are v1's exact list
(SKILL.md:89) treated as **examples, not a checklist** — first-match reporting per candidate, plus a
shallow root-level glob for the pattern-named ones (``*.csproj`` / ``*.bazel``). Scanned at
root-level (not a full recursive tree walk — bounded, and it never blows up on ``node_modules`` /
vendored trees); a deeply-nested manifest the shallow scan misses is still reachable by the model's
own grep (SKILL.md:89 "grep for version pins rather than assuming the repo has none"), so the
inventory is a convenience signal, never a gate.

Exit codes (architecture.md §3): 0 with the facts-block envelope present (``status`` is ``"ok"`` or
``"needs_decision"``); 2 on a usage error (no envelope). Any other non-zero is an unclassified hard
`gh`/`git` failure surfaced by the composed gather — stderr carries the faithful error.
