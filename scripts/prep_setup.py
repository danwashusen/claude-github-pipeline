"""prep_setup.py — the setup skill's complete starting-state facts block in one call
(architecture.md §4; §9.2 "inventory-in-one-call"; docs/implementation.md S17; docs/specs/setup.md).

Setup is the SINGLE write path for the consuming repo's marker-delimited configuration blocks
(``<!-- issue-resolver-* -->`` / ``<!-- pr-evaluator-* -->`` / ``<!-- worktree-setup/teardown -->`` /
``<!-- claude-code-stack-profile -->`` / ``<!-- github-pipeline-config -->``). Unlike the five pipeline
preps, setup does **no** GitHub gather — its whole subject is *local Markdown files*. So this prep
assembles a purely local starting state: the tool-availability preflight, the git-repo/``root.sha``
facts, and the multi-file block **inventory** (both candidate files' block lists, per-marker
classification, the legacy ``pr-evaluator-health-checks`` signal, the user-owned
``claude-code-stack-profile`` interior staged for re-ingest, and the same-marker-in-both-files
ambiguity) — as ONE JSON envelope on stdout, so the setup session's startup is one Python process,
never a chain of ``config_block.py list``/``read`` subprocess calls run from the router body.

Composition (architecture.md §2 "compose the executors in-process"; §1 "the only external processes
any script may spawn are git/gh"; S8 pattern lock)::

    config_block.build_list(file)                  -- each candidate file's `<status> <name>` inventory
    config_block.build_read(file, marker)          -- the user-owned stack-profile interior, staged for
                                                      the re-ingest base
    shutil.which("jq"/"git"/"gh")                  -- pure-Python tool presence (no subprocess)
    git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree / HEAD     -- prep-owned direct git call (the precedent every
                                                      other prep already established)

No ``redirect_stdout``/``io.StringIO`` capture of another script's stdout is used anywhere (S9-on
rule; docs/specs/baseline.md §5) — the composed cores return their payloads directly.

**No `gh` call, so no `AUTH_REQUIRED` from this prep.** Setup's inventory reads only local files;
the report-only ``gh auth status`` readiness probe stays a router-level environment check (v1's §1
main-loop probe), and the landing gate's own ``workspace.py ensure --work`` runs the real
root-freshness protocol + ``gh_persist.py create-pr`` runs the authenticated write. A malformed
(``dup``/``open``) config block is reported as an inventory **fact** (``class: "malformed"``), not a
``needs_decision`` — the router surfaces it to the operator via ``AskUserQuestion`` (docs/specs/setup.md
Invariants: "Malformed input is refused, not guessed"), matching v1's "surface these to the user"
handling. So this prep has no decision path (like ``workspace.py gc``/``lint``): its emitting envelope
is always ``status: "ok"``.

**No workspace, no root-freshness gate in prep** (same root-only shape ``prep_drafter``/
``prep_researcher`` adopted): the inventory reads the read-only ``main`` vantage; ``root.sha`` is a
plain informational ``git rev-parse HEAD``. Setup's tracked-file writes are staged in a work workspace
and land via an operator-gated PR (prd.md §8.2) — that gate lives in the flow's landing step, where
``workspace.py ensure --work`` gates root-freshness, not here.

Usage::

    prep_setup.py [--root PATH] [--scratch-dir PATH]

``--root`` defaults to ``.`` (the project root — architecture.md §6's read-only trust vantage).
``--scratch-dir`` defaults to ``/tmp/gh-setup-<root-basename>`` (CLAUDE.md's ``/tmp/gh-<skill>-<N>/``
convention) — where the flow later stages each approved block body before ``config_block.py upsert``,
and where this prep stages the stack-profile re-ingest base.

Exit codes (architecture.md §3): 0 with the facts-block envelope present (``status: "ok"``); 2 on a
usage error (no envelope). Any other non-zero is an unclassified hard `git` failure surfaced by the
composed git call — stderr carries the faithful error.
