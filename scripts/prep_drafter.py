"""prep_drafter.py — the drafter's complete facts block in one call (architecture.md §4;
docs/implementation.md S14; docs/specs/drafter.md). Assembles the session's entire starting
state — the two-way vector (new / revise), repo-context inventory (issue
templates, labels, grounding-doc presence), the `<!-- drafter-open-question-markers -->` config
block (or the heuristic-cue fallback signal), revise-mode facts (plan-marker presence, open-PR
list, closed-by-PR/project references), and the search-before-file open-question tracker de-dup — as
ONE JSON envelope on stdout, so the drafter session's startup is one Python process, never a
subprocess chain.

Composition (architecture.md §2 "compose the executors in-process"; §1 "the only external
processes any script may spawn are git/gh")::

                                                       in (`facts.ambient`), so a session invoked
                                                       from inside `epic/<N>-<slug>` can offer a
                                                       relationship instead of filing an orphan

Every executor composed here exposes a **pure, non-emitting core** — ``build_*(...) -> (payload,
notices, decision|None)`` (docs/specs/baseline.md §5, the S8 pattern lock). This prep calls those
cores **directly** and forwards each core's returned ``decision`` verbatim (:func:`_forward_decision`),
emitting exactly one envelope of its own. No ``redirect_stdout``/``io.StringIO`` capture of another
script's stdout is used anywhere in this module (S9-on rule; docs/specs/baseline.md §5).

``git rev-parse HEAD`` (root's own SHA, informational only) and ``gh label list`` / ``gh issue
view <NN> --json state,title,labels`` (per-story live-state fetch, mirroring `prep_planner.py`'s
identical `GATHER_EPIC`-reconciliation precedent) have no existing executor core — architecture.md
§1 permits any script to spawn `git`/`gh` directly via `pipelib.process.run`, the same precedent
`prep_planner.py`/`prep_resolver.py`/`prep_evaluator.py` already established for their own
prep-owned direct calls.

Usage::

    prep_drafter.py <owner/repo> [--issue N] [--root PATH] [--scratch-dir PATH] [--cwd PATH]
    prep_drafter.py <owner/repo> --oq-query "<topic>" [--oq-query "<topic>" ...]

``--root`` defaults to ``.`` (the project root — architecture.md §6's read-only trust vantage).
``--issue`` selects revise mode (any already-filed target, epic included — the target's type is read
mechanically from its own labels/title, never from operator intent); omitting it selects new mode. ``--scratch-dir`` defaults to ``/tmp/gh-drafter-<issue-or-"new">`` (CLAUDE.md's
``/tmp/gh-<skill>-<N>/`` convention) when omitted — this IS "staging conventions" from this step's
Work list: prep establishes and creates the directory every staged draft/revised body gets written
under at flow time (docs/specs/drafter.md "Artifacts written"); prep itself stages nothing, since no draft exists
yet at session start. ``--oq-query`` mirrors `prep_planner.py`'s identical one-shot flag (see
`oq_tracker.build_oq_query`'s docstring) and, when given, short-circuits to that one-shot payload —
no full facts assembly, matching planner's own CLI contract.

No ``--refresh`` flag: unlike the planner/resolver/evaluator, this prep runs no root-freshness
protocol and ensures no read/work workspace (see the "No workspace" paragraph below) — every fact
this script derives is already re-derived fresh on every invocation, so there is no expensive
one-time setup step for a `--refresh` flag to skip; adding one would be dead surface with no
distinguishable behavior.

**No workspace — the drafter grounds on the CURRENT checkout, not a pinned ref (docs/specs/drafter.md
"Repo context probe").** v1 drafts from wherever the operator's working tree
happens to be — `ls .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `gh label list`, `ls docs/prd.md ...` all run inline,
with no requirement that the tree be clean or on `main` (the skill's own primary trigger is "the user
is mid-development ... notices things," i.e. very plausibly *while* the tree is dirty on a feature
branch). Unlike the resolver/evaluator (whose gate config — test-target/checks/merge-policy — would weaken
a real merge gate if read from an untrusted ref, which is why their preps read those blocks from
the ambient checkout's working tree), the drafter's OQ-marker block only
informs a **detection hint** for drafting, never a merge/build gate — so reading the ambient
checkout "as-is" carries no gate-weakening exposure, and asserting or pinning anything here would
make this prep fail on the exact mid-feature-branch working tree its most common real trigger
describes. `root` therefore carries only `{path, sha}` (a plain,
non-gating `git rev-parse HEAD` — informational, never enforced) — no `workspace.py` import, no
`fresh` key (there is no freshness protocol here for that key to describe). Flagged for reviewer
scrutiny in the implementor report; not a defect if the reviewer weighs the threat model the same way.

**``facts.ambient`` — noticing that branch, not asserting it.** The same "grounds on the current
checkout" posture is what makes `branching.detect_ambient_issue` belong here: the branch the operator
is standing in is a *fact about this session* the drafter was previously blind to, so a session run
from inside `epic/95-<slug>` filed an issue with no link to #95 at all unless the operator typed one.
This is an offer, not a gate, and the distinction is the whole design — an unparseable branch, a
detached HEAD, or a failed issue lookup yields no fact (at most a
``AMBIENT_ISSUE_LOOKUP_UNAVAILABLE`` notice), never a ``needs_decision``, so nothing that files today
can start failing. It is emitted in BOTH modes, minus the self-referential case (revise mode standing
in the target's own branch has no relationship to offer). Adding it costs one `git` call always plus
one `gh` call only when the branch parses. The drafter still writes **no** parent edge: since #16 both
hierarchy edges are the slicer's (`skills/_shared/epic-story-hierarchy.md`), so the "child of #N"
answer resolves through the handoff pointing at a slicer adoption run.

Exit codes (architecture.md §3): 0 with the facts-block envelope present (``status`` is ``"ok"``
or ``"needs_decision"``); 2 on a usage error (no envelope). Any other non-zero is an unclassified
hard `gh`/`git` failure surfaced by a composed executor — stderr carries the faithful error.

**``vector.mode`` — the TWO-value closed set ``"new"`` / ``"revise"``.** Derived purely mechanically,
never from operator intent the script can't see:

  - no ``--issue`` -> ``"new"`` (``vector.type`` is ``None`` — Step 1's bug/incomplete/feature/
    epic/question classification is judgment over freeform feedback text; a script has no target
    issue to inspect yet, so it cannot and does not predict it — architecture.md §5: the router
    overrides `suggested_playbook` post-classification "on evidence the script cannot see").
  - ``--issue`` given -> ``"revise"``, whatever the target's type. An **epic target is an ordinary
    revise** since #16: the drafter revises one issue's body, and an epic's story set is the native
    sub-issue relation, so changing *which* stories exist is a slicer run at epic altitude rather than
    a body edit. A Story revise additionally verifies its Epic backlink line at flow time — the revise
    steps apply uniformly regardless of sub-type, so this prep forks no further mode for it.

  Before #16 an epic target selected a third mode, ``"epic-revise"``, whose facts carried the epic's
  story set (reconciled against live per-story state) for the drafter's epic-split playbook to
  re-order and batch-file into. That playbook is gone; the two-tier story read it needed now lives in
  ``prep_slicer.py``, where the reconciliation happens.

**``suggested_playbook``** (architecture.md §5 "Prep proposes; the router confirms") maps onto the
three playbook names — mirroring `prep_planner.py`'s identical `_suggested_playbook` precedent:

  - ``mode == "new"`` -> ``"new.md"`` (the router may override to ``question.md``
    post-classification — evidence this script cannot see ahead of reading the feedback text. An
    ``Epic`` classification needs no override: an epic is one issue, filed by ``new.md`` like any
    other, and its stories are cut afterwards by the slicer).
  - ``mode == "revise"``, ``vector.type == "question"`` -> ``"question.md"``.
  - ``mode == "revise"``, any other type (including ``epic``) -> ``"revise.md"``.

**The shared question-tracker search-before-file mechanism (S14 promotion; see `oq_tracker.py`'s own
module docstring for the full rationale).** `prep_planner.py`'s `_search_question_tracker` /
`_build_open_question_candidates` / `build_oq_query` — authored for S12/S13 as that module's own
local helpers — are now `oq_tracker.py`, a new single-purpose module, because this step needs the
byte-identical mechanism for its own search-before-file companion-question de-dup
(docs/specs/drafter.md Step 3.5/R4). `prep_planner.py` was refactored to call `oq_tracker`
in-process instead of carrying its own copy; its own test suite (`tests/test_prep_planner.py`) is
unmodified and green (verified). This module composes `oq_tracker.build_open_question_candidates`
(revise mode — the target issue body IS the source to scan) and `oq_tracker.build_oq_query`
(new mode's ``--oq-query`` one-shot — there is no issue body yet, so the operator names the topic
directly, mirroring `prep_planner.py`'s identical additive extension for a plan-time-detected OQ).

**Repo-context inventory (docs/specs/drafter.md "Repo context probe").** Issue templates
(`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*` — a plain filesystem listing at `root`, no `git`/`gh` call needed, since
`root` IS the drafter's grounding vantage per the "No workspace" note above), `gh label list` (repo
labels, live GitHub state, independent of `root`'s own git state), and the grounding docs the
CONSUMING repo declares in its `<!-- doc-catalogue -->` block (`skills/_shared/doc-catalogue.md`,
read via `doc_catalogue.read_catalogue` at `root` — the drafter's vantage is the ambient checkout,
so an uncommitted catalogue edit counts, unlike the planner's ensured checkout at `plan_ref`). The
long-standing `docs.prd` fact survives as the catalogue's `prd`-role entry; the four hardcoded
PRD candidate paths that preceded it are gone, along with the doc-layout assumption they encoded.

**Referenced-issue lookup, epic-backlink-open check: deliberately out of scope for this step.**
docs/specs/drafter.md's "Deterministic steps" table also names a referenced-issue lookup (`gh issue
view <N> --json title,state,body,labels`, for issue numbers the OPERATOR'S FEEDBACK TEXT names) and
docs/specs/drafter.md's "Epic closed (revising a Story)" gate — the epic-backlink-open check. Both depend on text the model
reads (the feedback, or the target's own body) that prep cannot see ahead of a session starting — the
router/playbook reads that text directly and, per architecture.md §1's "any script may spawn git/gh
directly," calls `gh issue view` itself at flow time for either case; this step's Build list (per the
implementor brief) does not name either as a facts-block field, so no dedicated one-shot CLI mode is
added here for them (unlike `--oq-query`, which the brief DOES name explicitly). Recorded here, not
silently dropped.
