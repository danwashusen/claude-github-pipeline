"""config_block.py — deterministic, idempotent read/write of the marker-delimited configuration
blocks the github-pipeline skills consume (e.g. `<!-- issue-resolver-fast-checks -->` … `<!--
/issue-resolver-fast-checks -->`), under the architecture.md §3 envelope.

This is the S21 Python port of v1's ``scripts/config-block.sh`` — the v1 file is a frozen
behavioral reference (still used by v1 callers until S20) and is **not** edited by this port. The
behavior contract is preserved exactly, re-expressed in envelope terms: same subcommands, same
argument shape, same canonical block form, same idempotency/no-op guarantees, same nonexistent-
file handling, same duplicate/unterminated-marker refusals. What changes is the wire format: `read`
still prints a block's interior to stdout as raw text, `list` still prints `<status> <name>` lines
as raw text, and `upsert`/`remove` now emit an architecture.md §3 JSON envelope (`{"status": "ok",
...}` or `{"status": "needs_decision", ...}`) instead of v1's bare `{"op": ..., "changed": ...}`
object, plus proper usage-error exit code 2.

This module does **no** GitHub or git I/O and shells out to nothing — it only reads/writes local
Markdown files. `workspace.py` (§6) delegates block reads to it for `<!-- worktree-setup/teardown
-->` discovery; `skills/setup/` (v2 rename of `github-pipeline-setup`) uses it for all block I/O.

Canonical block form: the line ``<!-- NAME -->`` on its own line, the block's interior lines, and
the line ``<!-- /NAME -->`` on its own line — each delimiter tolerant of surrounding leading/
trailing whitespace on its line, matched only after trimming. ``<marker-name>`` is the bare name
without comment syntax (e.g. ``issue-resolver-fast-checks``), constrained to ``^[A-Za-z0-9:_-]+$``
so a stray name can never smuggle in comment syntax that would confuse the delimiter scan (v1's
same rule, restated in Python-native terms rather than as a regex fed to `awk`).

Subcommands:
    config_block.py read   <file> <marker-name>
    config_block.py list   <file>
    config_block.py upsert <file> <marker-name> <body-path> [--dry-run] [--prepend]
    config_block.py remove <file> <marker-name>             [--dry-run]

``read``/``list`` print raw text (not an envelope) on success, matching v1 exactly, so a caller can
capture a block's contents or the inventory directly:
    - `read` exit 0: interior lines to stdout, one per line, no trailing envelope.
    - `read` exit 3: the named block is absent (this **includes** a nonexistent file — v1 treats
      "file doesn't exist" as "block doesn't exist," not a distinct error; verified against v1
      directly rather than inferred from prose).
    - `read` exit 4: `MARKER_AMBIGUOUS` — the marker's delimiter appears more than once.
    - `read` exit 5: the marker is unterminated (open with no close) or closes before it opens.
    - `list` exit 0 always, even against a nonexistent file (empty stdout — "no file" is "no
      blocks," not an error, matching v1 and docs/specs/setup.md's explicit note on this).
      Prints one `<status> <name>` line per discovered marker name: `ok` (well-formed, matching
      close present), `open` (unterminated), `dup` (declared more than once).

``upsert``/``remove`` emit exactly one architecture.md §3 JSON envelope on stdout:
    - `upsert` ok: `{"status": "ok", "op": "upsert", "marker": ..., "file": ..., "changed": ...,
      "dry_run": ..., "body_bytes": ..., "body_sha256": ..., "notices": []}`.
    - `remove` ok: `{"status": "ok", "op": "remove", "marker": ..., "file": ..., "changed": ...,
      "dry_run": ..., "notices": []}` (no `body_bytes`/`body_sha256` — remove stages no body).
    - Either, on a duplicate marker where the contract expects one: `{"status": "needs_decision",
      "decision": {"code": "MARKER_AMBIGUOUS", ...}, "notices": []}`, exit 0 (`needs_decision` is
      a valid outcome, not an error, per architecture.md §3).
    - `changed: false` means the file is already in the desired state and was **not touched on
      disk at all** — not even its mtime — matching v1's `finish_write`'s `cmp -s` short-circuit
      exactly (this is the idempotency guarantee the whole script exists to make deterministic:
      re-running `upsert` with the same body is a byte-level no-op, never a model-landed edit that
      merely happens to reproduce the same bytes).

Exit codes (usage/malformed-input paths only — these are NOT envelope-carrying; architecture.md §3:
exit 2 means no envelope is emitted):
    2   usage error, invalid marker name (`INVALID_MARKER_NAME: ...` on stderr), or a missing
        staged body file for `upsert` (`MISSING_BODY_FILE: ...` on stderr) — v1's own usage-error
        exit code, preserved verbatim rather than folded into a decision (these are malformed
        *invocations*, not a state the operator resolves via a decision card).
    3   (`read` only) the named block is absent.
    4   the named marker appears more than once — surfaced as exit code for `read`, and as a
        `MARKER_AMBIGUOUS` needs_decision envelope (exit 0) for `upsert`/`remove`, since those two
        already emit an envelope and architecture.md §3's decision-code path is how they express
        "found a state only the operator can resolve."
    5   the named marker is unterminated / closes before it opens (`read` only — `upsert`/`remove`
        also refuse this shape, but v1 has no dedicated decision code for it distinct from
        malformed content, so it stays a bare exit 5 on all four subcommands for consistency with
        `read`, matching v1's own uniform treatment).

Marker discovery order: `list`'s per-name ordering is **not** part of the v1 contract — the
`.sh` implementation's order is `awk`'s associative-array iteration order (verified directly:
hash order, not file order, not alphabetical), an implementation artifact of that interpreter, not
a documented behavior. This port instead orders `list` output deterministically by each marker's
first line of first appearance in the file, so the same input always produces the same output
across runs and across platforms — a strictly stronger guarantee than v1 offered, and consistent
with "same output fields" (the fields are `status name`; the field *order* was never specified).
