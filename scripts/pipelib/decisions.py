"""The closed decision-code vocabulary (architecture.md §3) and the ``needs_decision`` payload
builder.

Every script and judgment sub-agent in v2 signals an operator-only choice with one of exactly
these 13 codes — contract tokens, exact strings, never paraphrased or extended ad hoc. Adding a
code is a contract change: update architecture.md §3 and this module together, in the same
change, or ``tests/test_pipelib.py``'s drift-check test (which parses the code list back out of
the doc and asserts it equals :data:`DECISION_CODES`) fails.

Meaning + canonical emitter per code (architecture.md §3):

- ``AUTH_REQUIRED`` — `gh` authentication/permission failure; detected by the pipelib subprocess
  runner (:mod:`pipelib.process`), any script.
- ``EMPTY_BODY_FILE`` — body-bearing write given an empty or missing staged file; ``gh_persist.py``.
- ``MARKER_AMBIGUOUS`` — more than one candidate marker comment/block where the contract expects
  one; the gathers + ``config_block.py``.
- ``TARGET_IS_PR`` — the requested issue number resolves to a pull request, not an issue;
  ``gh_gather.py``, emitted before any further fetch so a composing prep forwards it before any
  workspace side effect.
- ``DOD_MALFORMED`` — a DoD bullet or annotation outside the closed set; ``parse.py dod``.
- ``PHASES_MALFORMED`` — a plan ``## Phases`` section that doesn't parse; ``parse.py phases``.
- ``BRANCH_IN_USE`` — the branch is checked out in another worktree (``ensure --work``, reached
  via the landing tools and workspace-open); ``workspace.py``.
- ``WORKSPACE_MISMATCH`` — the ambient checkout is not the expected workspace (wrong or detached
  branch, session at the project root, checkout stale against the expected remote state, or
  removal attempted from inside the target worktree); ``workspace.py``, forwarded by the stage
  preps.
- ``PLAN_MISSING`` — a required plan is absent; prep scripts + the state-distiller.
- ``THREAD_SUPERSEDED_PLAN`` — thread direction supersedes the recorded plan; the state-distiller.
- ``AMBIGUOUS`` — residual non-marker ambiguity (e.g. multiple epic-branch matches); scripts +
  sub-agents.
- ``BLOCKED_ON_USER`` — progress requires operator input beyond a listable option set; sub-agents.
- ``TARGET_IS_SLICE`` — the requested issue is a deliverable slice (its native parent classifies as
  a non-epic, and a non-epic's sub-issues are slices by construction); ``prep_workspace_open.py``
  and ``prep_planner.py``. A slice has no branch and no PR of its own, so opening a workspace for it
  promotes it to a story and planning it standalone authors a plan competing with its parent's. The
  card always offers proceeding — classification reads the parent's labels/title, so an epic
  carrying neither the ``epic`` label nor an ``Epic:`` title prefix reads as a non-epic.

# are informational, not gating). ``DEPS_UNSUPPORTED``, ``SUBISSUES_UNSUPPORTED`` and

# features gate independently: blocked-by/blocking dependencies and parent/sub-issue hierarchy are
# different GitHub relations, and reporting one when the other degraded would send a reader to the
# wrong fallback. On this notice, epic↔story hierarchy readers fall back to parsing the legacy

SUBISSUES_UNSUPPORTED = "SUBISSUES_UNSUPPORTED"

# A READ of the parent/sub-issue relation could not retrieve one field (`gh issue view --json parent`

# from ``SUBISSUES_UNSUPPORTED`` for the same "wrong fallback" reason that keeps that one separate from
# ``DEPS_UNSUPPORTED``: consumers read ``SUBISSUES_UNSUPPORTED`` as a WRITE outcome — the relation was
# not established, so a filed child is unparented — and the slicer's flow aborts its cut on it. A
# failed read has written nothing and leaves nothing unparented; conflating the two would abort a cut
# and report a child that does not exist. On this notice a reader treats the parent as UNKNOWN, never
# as absent.

# The consuming repo declares no grounding documents: no ``docs/README.md``, no

# *no doc grounding at all* — there is no built-in path list to fall back to and no filesystem walk,
# so a planner or drafter that would once have read a hardcoded ``docs/prd.md`` now grounds on
# nothing. The remedy is always the same (author the catalogue, or re-run `setup`), which is why one
# notice serves every reader; what a reader DOES about it differs by consumer, and that asymmetry
# lives in the shared contract, not here.
