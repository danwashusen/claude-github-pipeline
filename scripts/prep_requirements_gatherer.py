"""prep_requirements_gatherer.py — the requirements-gatherer's complete facts block in one call
(architecture.md §4). Assembles the session's entire starting state — the target issue + thread,
its type, the **refusal** set (the conditions under which gathering requirements onto this issue
would be wrong), the parsed `## Definition of done` (so the flow appends without re-deriving
indexes), and the consuming repo's declared grounding docs — as ONE JSON envelope on stdout, so
the session's startup is one Python process, never a subprocess chain.

The requirements-gatherer interactively elicits requirements from the operator for one target
issue and appends them to that issue's `## Definition of done` as plain unticked criterion
bullets, each opening with a stable `**REQ-<issue>-<seq>**` id and closing with a provenance
tail — a source-doc citation, or `operator elicited <date>`
(`skills/requirements-gatherer/references/requirements-format.md`). Its only write surface is the
issue body via `gh_persist.py edit-body`; it edits no tracked files and files no issues.

Composition (architecture.md §2 "compose the executors in-process"; §1 "the only external
processes any script may spawn are git/gh")::

    gh_gather.run(..., stream=)      -- the target's body/thread + native blocked_by/blocking + the
                                        native parent/sub_issues relation + the implementation-plan
                                        marker, in ONE round-trip
    branching.detect_type_with_question -- the shared epic/story/question/standard core (import-only)
    parse.parse_dod_bullets          -- the existing DoD, parsed with 1-based indexes so the flow
                                        appends after the last top-level bullet, never re-counting
    parse.has_dod_section            -- whether the section exists at all (create-vs-append fact)
    parse.dod_malformed_decision     -- the shared DOD_MALFORMED decision builder
    pipelib.spill.read_section       -- the inline|path read-back for the spilled body
    doc_catalogue.read_catalogue     -- the consuming repo's `<!-- doc-catalogue -->` grounding docs

Plus ONE direct `gh issue view <parent> --json state,title,labels` via
`branching.fetch_parent_state` — and only when the target actually has a parent — because the
sub-issue/parent node shape carries **no labels** (`epic-story-hierarchy.md` "The facts"), so the
parent cannot be typed from the gather alone.

Usage::

    prep_requirements_gatherer.py <issue> <owner/repo> [--root PATH] [--scratch-dir PATH] [--cwd PATH]

**No workspace — the gatherer grounds on the CURRENT checkout**, the same root-only vantage
`prep_drafter.py` and `prep_slicer.py` take, and for the same threat-model reason: it reads no PR
head and gates no merge, so architecture.md §6's "a PR must not weaken its own gates" cannot
apply. It runs before any workspace exists (its output is input to planning, which precedes
`workspace-open`). `root` therefore carries only `{path, sha}` — informational, never enforced —
and the doc catalogue is read at that same working vantage, deliberately NOT through `refblocks`:
a catalogue names no gate (`skills/_shared/doc-catalogue.md` "Where the catalogue is read from").

**Refusals are facts, not decision codes** (the `prep_slicer` ruling, applied verbatim):
`vector.refusals` is a list of reason tokens from a closed set; the router renders the matching
refusal summary and stops. They are deliberately NOT `needs_decision` codes — a refusal is a
routing outcome with its own breadcrumb, not an ambiguity one card resolves.

  - ``epic-target``     — an epic's DoD is outcome-level ("all stories are closed"); nothing ever
                          projects or verifies criterion bullets on it — requirements belong on
                          its stories. The breadcrumb points at the open stories, or the drafter
                          when none exist yet.
  - ``slice-target``    — a slice carries `## Acceptance criteria` owned by the slicer, not a DoD
                          (`epic-story-hierarchy.md`: a DoD on a slice would be a checkbox set
                          nothing ticks). The breadcrumb points at the parent story.
  - ``question-target`` — a `question` issue carries no DoD by contract
                          (`skills/_shared/question-issue.md`); a human answers it in its thread.
  - ``closed-target``   — criteria appended to delivered work can never be projected or verified.

An OPEN native blocker is deliberately NOT a refusal — elicitation is upstream human input, and
an unanswered dependency does not invalidate what the operator states this issue must do. Open
blockers ride in `attention` instead, so the operator sees them.

`DOC_CATALOGUE_ABSENT` stays a **notice**, never a refusal: this skill's output is
operator-elicited, so it is the proceeding kind of catalogue consumer
(`skills/_shared/doc-catalogue.md` "When the catalogue is absent") — the grounding-selection gate
simply has nothing to suggest and collects operator-named sources instead.

A malformed DoD annotation IS a blocking `DOD_MALFORMED` decision (forwarded from the parse
core): appending to a section the parser cannot index risks colliding with whatever the malformed
line was trying to record — the operator repairs the bullet or aborts before this skill writes.
**Refusals win over the malformed-DoD decision**: on a refused target the DoD is not parsed at
all (`dod: null`) — the write-collision rationale only applies when a write can happen, and a
repair card demanding a hand-fix on an issue the session refuses anyway is noise.

The gather's marker lookup targets the `<!-- implementation-plan:v1 -->` comment, and
`plan.present` is a first-class fact: an issue with a verified plan is **mid-flight** even before
any bullet carries an annotation — a plan with no `## Phases` section makes the resolver's
single-phase fallback tick EVERY top-level DoD bullet on its next push, so appended REQ bullets
would be silently claimed as delivered. The flow's mid-flight gate keys on `plan.present` OR
`dod.annotated_count`.

Exit codes (architecture.md §3): 0 with the facts-block envelope present (``status`` is ``"ok"``
or ``"needs_decision"``); 2 on a usage error (no envelope). Any other non-zero is an unclassified
hard `gh`/`git` failure surfaced by the composed gather — stderr carries the faithful error.
