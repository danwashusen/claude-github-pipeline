"""``gh_gather.py`` — the fixed issue-fetch envelope (architecture.md §3, §7's ``GATHER_ISSUE``),
ported from v1's ``gh-gather.sh``. One round-trip issue fetch (body + full comment thread + labels
+ state) instead of several, with the same byte-threshold spill routing and native-dependency
capability-gating v1 established — re-expressed as a §3 envelope instead of v1's ad-hoc JSON.

Usage::

    gh_gather.py <issue> <owner/repo> [marker_prefix] [scratch_dir] [--extra-json FIELDS]

Positional order matches v1 exactly (the v1 executor agent's ``GATHER_ISSUE(issue, repo,
marker_prefix?, scratch_dir?)``); ``--extra-json`` is the one caller-facing knob v1 handled as a
v1-executor special case (its "If the caller passes extra_json=<fields>..." paragraph) and is
ported here as an optional flag rather than a fifth positional, since it's rare and named at every
real call site (the drafter's revise-mode ``closedByPullRequestsReferences,projectItems`` lookup).

Behavior preserved from v1 (see module-level comments at each step below for the "why"):

- **Thread pagination** — the full comment thread via the paginated REST endpoint, never the
  ``gh issue view --json comments`` ~100-comment cap.
- **Marker discovery** — comments whose body starts with ``marker_prefix``, with
  ``marker_comment_count`` always reported; **more than one is a v2-native ``MARKER_AMBIGUOUS``
  decision** (v1 only reported the count and left the ambiguity call to its caller; the port makes
  it a first-class §3 decision per this step's DoD and architecture.md §3's decision-code table
  naming "the gathers" as a ``MARKER_AMBIGUOUS`` emitter).
- **PR-number guard (v2-native)** — issues and PRs share one number space and ``gh issue view``
  silently returns the PR when given a PR number; the fetched ``url`` (``/pull/<N>`` vs
  ``/issues/<N>``) is the discriminator, and a PR target is a ``TARGET_IS_PR`` decision emitted
  **before any further round-trip**, with the PR body's closing-keyword issue references
  (``Fixes #62``) surfaced in the decision context so the operator can re-target the origin issue.
- **Threshold spill** — body / thread / marker comment body via ``pipelib.spill``.
- **Native issue dependencies** — ``blocked_by`` / ``blocking`` + ``deps_available``,
  capability-gated: an "unknown field" rejection from `gh` degrades to the base field set plus a
  ``DEPS_UNSUPPORTED`` notice; any other failure is a hard failure (exit 1, no envelope) because
  silently defaulting ``deps_available: false`` on a real transient/auth/rate-limit error would
  hide a genuine native blocker from the resolver's/evaluator's hard gate on ``blocked_by``.
- **Native parent/sub-issue hierarchy** — ``parent`` / ``sub_issues`` / ``sub_issues_summary`` +
  ``subissues_available``, gated the same way and INDEPENDENTLY (see
  :func:`_fetch_issue_with_relation_capability_gates`), with its own ``SUBISSUES_UNSUPPORTED``
  notice because its fallback differs: epic↔story hierarchy readers drop back to parsing the
  legacy ``## Stories`` checklist, not to prose dependency links. This is the relation that drives
  GitHub's sub-issue panel, the epic's progress rollup, and a Project's Sub-issues progress field —
  none of which a markdown checklist can drive.
- **`AUTH_REQUIRED` classification** — every `gh` call this module makes is checked for the
  pipelib runner's auth-failure classification (``CommandResult.auth_required``) ahead of any
  other failure branch; an authenticated-required `gh` exit (gh's own exit code 4) emits a
  ``needs_decision`` ``AUTH_REQUIRED`` envelope (exit 0) instead of the undifferentiated hard
  failure (exit 1) a plain non-zero `gh` exit would otherwise produce — same treatment
  ``gh_pr_gather.py`` and ``gh_persist.py`` give every one of their `gh` calls.

Every ``gh`` call passes ``--repo <owner/repo>`` explicitly — this module never relies on ambient
cwd (S21 brief's cwd-discipline advisory), so it behaves identically regardless of where the
caller (a prep script, S6+) is sitting.

**Open-PR search false-positive fix (S12 follow-up round).** ``_fetch_open_prs``'s ``--search "<N>
in:body"`` query is a GitHub full-text search, not a literal-string match — live evidence against
the sandbox repo (``gh pr list --search "2 in:body"``) showed it returning PRs whose body merely
contains the digit ``2`` as part of unrelated prose (``"## Phase tracker\n- [x] Phase 2 — ..."``,
present in nearly every multi-phase PR body), never referencing issue ``#2`` at all — and a second
control run with ``--search "#2 in:body"`` (the hash-prefixed form) returned the **identical**
false-positive set, proving GitHub's server-side search does not use the ``#`` as an anchor either
(the query *form* does not protect against this; only a client-side post-filter does). This module
now fetches ``body``/``closingIssuesReferences`` alongside the search results and filters them
through :func:`references_issue` before returning — a genuine ``#<N>`` reference (boundary-guarded
on both sides, matching GitHub's own autolink semantics: ``#2`` never matches ``#20``/``#12`` (a
longer shared-prefix number) or ``#2abc``/``#2E8B57`` (a hex color or any other alphanumeric token
glued onto the digits — a false positive the S12 acceptance review reproduced directly), and prose
like "Phase 2"/"issue 2" with no ``#`` never matches) or membership in ``closingIssuesReferences``.
The returned ``open_prs`` payload shape is
unchanged (``body``/``closingIssuesReferences`` are stripped back off after filtering) — this is a
correctness fix to *which* PRs are returned, not a facts-block schema change. See
``docs/specs/resolver.md`` / ``docs/specs/planner.md`` "Known bugs/gaps" for the newly-discovered
v1-inherited defect this closes (v1's ``gh-gather.sh`` has the identical false-positive exposure;
v2 fixes it here, an intentional, explained parity divergence).
