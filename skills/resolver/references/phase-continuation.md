# Phase continuation — the checkpoint after a non-final phase ships

Read at the spine's "Return to the routed playbook" when a phase has shipped and an unshipped phase
remains (S5.2 pushed it, S6 projected it, S7 filed its follow-ups). It decides whether this session
ships the next phase too or ends with the non-final handoff. This **phase checkpoint** is not
[`follow-up-tracking.md`](follow-up-tracking.md)'s end-of-loop checkpoint: that `file-at-checkpoint`
batch ran at S7, minutes earlier, and is never a reason to pause.

**The rule this file serves:** a continuation is a new **pass** through the spine — a fresh
continue-mode run in everything but the conversation. Each phase gets its own prep, push, tracker tick,
DoD projection, cold read, and loop comment, seeded from GitHub exactly as a new session's would be — so
the evaluator, the tracker, and a later session cannot tell which phases shared a session. Wherever the
spine or its references scope a rule to "this run" or "one run", it means this pass. The `## Handoff`
ends the **session** (SKILL.md §4), never a pass: a pass that continues emits none.

## 1. Hard stops — no card, the existing handoff

The next phase is the first unticked row of the `## Phase tracker` S6 just wrote whose `depends-on` is
satisfied — never selected by title.

- The next phase is `operator` / `decision-only` — mid-plan, or trailing the last code phase → the
  operator-phase handoff. The resolver cannot run it, and the PR stays draft: the ready flip waits for
  every phase to be ticked (the spine's "Return to the routed playbook").
- The run is exiting on a re-route, or is a revision run → that run's own handoff; there is nothing to
  chain.

Only a shipped **last planned** phase skips this file — nothing remains, and the spine's ready flip and
forward handoff own it.

## 2. Pause or continue

Pause when **any** of these holds; otherwise continue:

- the shipped phase's `checkpoint` (`facts.phases`) is not `continue` — `pause`, or `null` (absent: a
  plan authored before the key, or a phase the planner left unmarked);
- the session holds `--pause` (SKILL.md §1);
- a **warning sign** fired during this phase's pass:
  - a gate card rendered — `Audit`, `Doc conflict`, `Tracker drift`, `Tests red`, `Review loop`,
    `Settled item`, `Decision`, `Loop stall` (the emergency ceiling included) — whatever the continuing
    answer was;
  - this pass wrote an override or failure record to the PR body — `## Audit override`,
    `## Plan override`, `## Known failures`, an `Accept current` override, a `## Tracker reconciliation`
    note.

Warning signs only turn `continue` into a pause. Nothing turns a `pause` into `continue`: the planner's
key and the operator's flag are the floor, and "this phase was routine" is a judgment about your own
work. Not warning signs: the S7 follow-up confirmation, settled findings (Plan-settled,
Deferred-by-plan, Refuted), and cold-read findings the loop fixed.

## 3. The phase link

`<pr-url>/files/<entry-sha>..<head-sha>` — the PR's Files-changed view scoped to **this phase's** push.
`<entry-sha>` is this pass's prep `facts.workspace.upstream_sha` — the pushed tip the phase started
from, which is `facts.workspace.sha` unless an interrupted run left commits unpushed (those are this
phase's work, so the link must include them). It is not the session-entry anchor the handoff's
`Changes:` line uses. `<head-sha>` is `git rev-parse HEAD` in `facts.workspace.path` after S5.2. When
the entry SHA is not a commit in the PR — fresh-mode phase 1, where it is the PR's base commit and the
whole PR is this phase — link `<pr-url>/files`: the discriminating test of
[`../../_shared/handoff-format.md`](../../_shared/handoff-format.md)'s `Changes:` rule. The PR url is
`facts.prior_pr.url`, or the `create-pr` envelope's `url` on a fresh first phase; SHAs in the text are
7-char.

## 4. The checkpoint card

Print one line first, so the link is clickable in the transcript:

> **Phase <N> — <title> shipped** (<K> of <M>) · <phase link> · paused: <`checkpoint: pause` | `--pause` | the warning sign>

Then one `AskUserQuestion` (`header: "Checkpoint"`), its question carrying the phase link and naming the
next phase:

- **Continue here** — description: the next phase's title, `deliverable`, and `closes-dod`.
- **End session** — description: the non-final handoff; the next session starts on a fresh context.

Free text ("Other") is an operator note, and continues. Carry it into the next phase as an Addressable
human comment in iteration 1's input, and record it verbatim in that phase's loop comment (S5.2) so it
reaches GitHub. A note that reverses a locked decision is caught by the fix plan's plan-reversal check
and re-enters the `Decision` card there.

No pause → print the same line ending `· continuing to Phase <N+1> — <title> (checkpoint: continue)`,
and continue.

## 5. Continue

1. Delete this phase's staging files from `facts.scratch` — `pr.md`, `issue-body-projected.md`,
   `review-diff.patch`, `cold-read-diff.patch`, any `slice-<M>-ticked.md`. A surviving fresh-mode
   `pr.md` restaged by a later `edit-pr-body` would overwrite the tracker tick S6 just wrote. The next
   pass's first PR-body write restages from `facts.tracker.body_path` — the PR body the new prep
   fetched, which at that point *is* the body this session last wrote — and S6's "restage from the body
   this run last wrote" rule governs every write after that pass's own S5.2.
2. Re-run prep **in full** — `prep_resolver.py <issue> <owner/repo>`, **no `--refresh`**. `--refresh`
   skips the workspace assertion, so it returns no `facts.workspace` and no reachable
   `facts.tracker.last_shipped` (the next phase's review base). The setup hooks re-run, deliberately: a
   phase can change what setup installs (a new dependency), and a new session would re-run them too, so
   skipping them would break the rule above. The new facts block replaces the old one wholesale — it now
   reads `vector.mode: continue` on this session's own PR — with one value carried over: the **first**
   prep's `facts.workspace.upstream_sha`, the session-entry anchor of the handoff's `Changes:` line. Note
   it before the first re-run; every later prep reports the next phase's start instead.
3. Re-enter the spine at **S1** in continue mode (S2 skips there, as it always does) and skip S1.5 —
   the printed line already named the phase. Every per-run state in the spine and its references starts
   over, seeded only from GitHub as a new session's would be: S5.1's loop-entry SHA, the addressed- and
   refuted-items lists, defect counts, the grace round and the ceiling count, the cold read, and any
   guard rail's settled answer.
4. **Warning sign before building.** The thread may have moved during the phase or at the card. Compare
   this pass's `facts.sections.thread_comment_count` with the previous prep's: when it rose **and** this
   pass's distiller reports `thread-vs-plan: refines` citing one of those new comments, print the
   refinement and render the `Checkpoint` card before S3, its question naming the refinement —
   **Continue here** builds the plan as refined; **End session** hands off. A refinement the thread
   already carried when the session started never pauses a later pass: the session's first pass built
   on it, and `refines` is a whole-thread judgment, so it would otherwise fire on every pass.

## 6. Ending the session

End session (or a hard stop) → the routed playbook's handoff, composed per
[`handoff-renderings.md`](handoff-renderings.md): it owns the session-wide `Changes:` line (anchored on
the value step 2 carried, with per-phase ranges when the session shipped more than one phase) and the
trailing `--pause` on resolver re-entry commands.
