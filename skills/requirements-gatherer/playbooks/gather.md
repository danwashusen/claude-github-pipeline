# Gather — suggest grounding, elicit, land on the DoD

The one flow (`vector.refusals: []`). All facts come from the prep facts block (SKILL.md §1); the
session's only GitHub write is step 5's gated `edit-body`. The presentation shapes and the bullet
grammar live in [`../references/requirements-format.md`](../references/requirements-format.md) —
read it before step 3.

## 1. Read the target

Read the issue body + full thread from `facts.sections` (spilled paths) and `facts.target`. The
thread may have moved past the body — the latest accepted direction wins. `facts.dod.bullets` is
the existing DoD as current state: these are already-recorded requirements; you extend the set,
never redraft it. `facts.attention` may carry open blockers or the mid-flight warning (an
implementation plan or annotated bullets) — surface each to the operator up front, one line each.

## 2. Gate G1 — grounding selection

Present the **full** catalogue from `facts.grounding_docs` — `binding` entries first, then
`informative`, each as `path · role · summary` — and mark which look relevant to this issue's
topic (your judgment: role + summary against the issue's title, body, and thread). Show
everything; never silently filter. Then ask (`header: "Grounding"`): confirm the marked set,
or add / drop — the operator may name paths the catalogue doesn't carry, or non-doc sources.

When the catalogue is absent (`DOC_CATALOGUE_ABSENT` notice) or empty, say so plainly and ask the
operator to name sources — possibly none. That is not a refusal: this skill's output is
operator-elicited, so it proceeds ungrounded where a document-derived stage would stop
([`../../_shared/doc-catalogue.md`](../../_shared/doc-catalogue.md), the deliberate asymmetry).
Carry a `/github-pipeline:setup` breadcrumb into the summary.

## 3. Draft the candidate set

Read the approved grounding docs by absolute path (`grounding_docs[].abs_path`, or the paths the
operator named). Draft the enumerated candidate set — for each requirement: its **stable id**
(`REQ-<issue>-<seq>`, assigned now from `facts.dod.next_req_seq` and counting up, so the id the
operator approves is the id that lands), a **one-line falsifiable criterion** (criterion +
exemption classes, the drafter's DoD altitude), its **provenance** (the doc §heading or register
id that records it, or `operator elicited`), and any acceptance detail. Ground every
doc citation in text you actually read — a requirement you can't cite is operator-elicited or it
doesn't exist; never invent a doc anchor. A `binding` doc that contradicts the issue is a
conflict to surface, not design around.

## 4. Gate G2 — the elicitation loop

Show the set in the reference's presentation shape (id · criterion · provenance · detail),
existing DoD bullets listed first as current state. Ask: **"anything to add, change, or
remove?"** (freeform prose gate, not a card). Iterate — additions get the next `REQ-<issue>-<seq>`;
a dropped candidate's id is skipped, never reassigned; a contested point (operator unsure,
stakeholders disagree, an unanswerable dependency) is moved to a **Contested** list, not forced
into a bullet. Loop until
the operator explicitly approves the set. Silence or a tweak is keep-iterating, never approval.

## 5. Gate G3 — the DoD write

1. **Mid-flight warning** (when `facts.dod.annotated_count > 0` **or** `facts.plan.present`):
   annotated bullets mean appending changes the top-level bullet count, so the resolver's next
   projection will block and re-route to the planner
   ([`../../_shared/dod-annotations.md`](../../_shared/dod-annotations.md) index stability — the
   correct consequence of adding scope mid-flight); a bare plan marker means the issue is planned
   even with zero annotations — and a plan with no `## Phases` section makes the resolver's
   single-phase fallback tick **every** top-level bullet on its next push, silently claiming the
   appended requirements as delivered. Gate (`header: "DoD in flight"`): **Append anyway** /
   **Abort** — never proceed silently.
2. Build the revised body: the current body **byte-for-byte**, with one new bullet per approved
   requirement appended after the last existing top-level DoD bullet, in approved order, each in
   the reference's grammar. When `facts.dod.present` is false, append a `## Definition of done`
   section at the end of the body.
3. Show the diff — the added bullets only, "(everything else unchanged)" — and wait for
   **explicit** confirmation (freeform prose gate — a diff, not a fresh draft card).
4. Stage the full revised body to `<facts.scratch>/dod-body.md`, then **validate the staged body
   before writing** — a bullet whose cited anchor happens to end the line with an
   annotation-lookalike parenthetical would land fine and then block every downstream DoD parse:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/parse.py dod "<facts.scratch>/dod-body.md"
```

   A `DOD_MALFORMED` result names the offending bullet — sanitize its `(`/`)` per the reference's
   anchor rule, re-stage, and re-validate; write only on an `ok` envelope.
5. Write:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh_persist.py edit-body <owner/repo> <N> "<facts.scratch>/dod-body.md"
```

An empty/missing staged file exits `EMPTY_BODY_FILE` and writes nothing — re-stage and re-run
with the same path. A zero exit with `body_sha256` **is** the confirmation. On decline at either
gate: nothing is written; report the staged path so the operator can inspect what would have
landed.

## 6. Summary

End with the plain summary **SKILL.md §4 specifies — that list is the single source; don't
restate it here**. Two playbook-local renderings: the grounding line is one line per source read
(or "none — operator declined grounding"), and every landed `REQ-<issue>-<seq>` id is named
explicitly — the ids are what a plan phase or slice grounding cites.
