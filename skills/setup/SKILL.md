description: Configure (or re-configure) a repository so the github-pipeline skills — resolver, evaluator, planner — actually work in it, by writing the marker-delimited command blocks they read from COMMANDS.md / CLAUDE.md. Use this skill right after installing the plugin, or any time the pipeline can't find how to test/check a repo: phrases like "set up the pipeline", "configure the pipeline for this repo", "onboard this repo to github-pipeline", "the resolver doesn't know how to run my tests", "configure the fast-checks / static-checks", "set up the COMMANDS.md markers", "how do I tell the evaluator which suite to run", "migrate my health-checks block", or "re-run setup" all qualify. Trigger this even when the user doesn't name a specific marker — if they're wiring this plugin into a project, or a pipeline skill reported a missing `<!-- … -->` block, this is the skill. Detects the project's existing lint/test/build commands and proposes drafts; is safe to run repeatedly (idempotent — reconciles in place, never duplicates); offers to migrate legacy single-block declarations and to dry-run the commands it writes. Also proposes a concise, up-to-date `claude-code-stack-profile` block for CLAUDE.md — general guidance on running the repo's tech stack efficiently in a Claude Code session (background slow commands, log verbose output instead of flooding context). Does NOT itself draft, plan, or resolve issues — it only configures the conventions the other skills depend on, plus that one general operating-guidance block.

# setup — router

Make a repository ready for the `github-pipeline` skills. The resolver, evaluator, and planner carry
no per-project config — they read it at use-time from **marker-delimited blocks** the consuming repo
declares in `COMMANDS.md` (preferred) or `CLAUDE.md`. Setup is the single place the **plugin** writes
those blocks: it inventories what's declared, grounds candidates from repo evidence, interviews the
operator for what can't be inferred, confirms every draft as a diff, stages the writes in a workspace,
and **offers** the landing (commit + push + PR) as one final gate. One interactive session; it edits
local Markdown, never GitHub state. Read this router, run prep, run the one flow, close with a summary.
Your judgment is detection/grounding, the interview answers, the diff-and-confirm, and the
research-and-propose blocks.

## 1. Prep

Assemble the entire starting state in **one** call — no `gh` gather (setup's subject is local files):

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/prep_setup.py [--root <path>]
```

It returns one JSON **facts block** (`architecture.md §4`): `preflight` (`git_repo` + `tools.jq/git/gh`
presence), `root` (`path`/`sha`), `inventory` (`files` — each candidate file's `blocks`; `known_markers`
— every block classified **present / legacy / malformed / missing** with its file(s); `legacy_health_checks`;
`stack_profile` — present + the staged re-ingest `base_path`; `config_header`; `same_marker_both_files`),
`target_file` (suggested canonical file + `split`), `scratch`, and `attention`. Consume each as **data**
— never re-scan the files prep already listed. A `needs_decision` from prep has no path here (no `gh`
call); a `malformed` block is a **fact to surface** (§3), not a decision.

## 2. Route — one linear flow

Setup has **no mode fork**: a single linear flow — inventory → detect → propose → stage → validate →
land → summary. Legacy migration and the landing approve/decline are **fact/runtime gates inside** the
flow, never routes. One playbook — read it and run it end to end:

| Facts | Playbook |
|---|---|
| any setup run | [`playbooks/setup-flow.md`](playbooks/setup-flow.md) |

Before drafting any block, the flow forces a `Read` of
[`references/block-authoring.md`](references/block-authoring.md) — exact shape per block, detection
heuristics, the stack-profile scope, the legacy mapping, worked examples. Its canonical block **forms**
are byte-identical to the frozen schema in
[`../../docs/specs/examples/config-blocks.md`](../../docs/specs/examples/config-blocks.md) (prd.md §7,
row 11) — write exactly those bytes; never restate a form divergently.

## 3. Invariants

- **`config_block.py` is the single write path.** Every block read/write goes through it
  (`read`/`list`/`upsert`/`remove`) — never hand-roll `sed`/`Edit`/`Write` against a marker block.
  Idempotency lives in that code, not in a byte-perfect edit; `upsert` returns `changed: false` when
  already correct. Stage each body to `facts.scratch/<marker>.md`, then pass the **path** (the
  `gh_persist.py` discipline — nothing re-serializes a body across a prompt boundary).
- **Malformed input is refused, not guessed.** A `dup`/`open` block means the repo is already in a state
  the resolver/evaluator parsers trip on — surface it via `AskUserQuestion` for a hand fix.
- **`claude-code-stack-profile` is user-owned: re-ingest, never overwrite.** Machine-parsed blocks + the
  `github-pipeline-config` header are plugin-owned, reconciled to canonical every run; the stack-profile
  is seeded when absent and, when present, kept as the base (`stack_profile.base_path`) with only
  currency refinements layered on.
- **Everything lands via an operator-gated PR (prd.md §8.2).** Setup never edits the read-only root:
  approved writes are staged in a **work workspace**, and the landing (commit + push + a PR whose body
  summarizes the block diffs) is **one explicit final gate**. On decline: **no git actions** — the
  summary reports the workspace path + ready-to-run landing commands.
- **Preflight reports gaps; it never auto-fixes.** A missing `jq`/`git`/`gh` or an unauthenticated `gh`
  is surfaced with a one-line fix — setup never logs in, installs, or touches the machine. Leave the
  *runtime* markers (`implementation-plan:v1`, `issue-research:v1`, the health-cache marker) alone.

## 4. Summary — not a `## Handoff`

Setup is **not** a pipeline stage: no cross-session handoff, no GitHub state. It ends with a plain
**summary** (the flow's last step): the target file(s) + per-block disposition (written / reconciled /
already-correct / skipped; the stack-profile in its own seeded / refreshed / already-current
vocabulary), the landing outcome (PR opened with the block-diff summary, **or** the workspace path +
ready-to-run commands on decline), outstanding preflight `✗`s, and a copy-pasteable next-step pointer
(`/github-pipeline:drafter` on your first feedback, or `/github-pipeline:resolver <issue#>`) — a
pointer, not a pipeline command, since there is no session state to carry.
