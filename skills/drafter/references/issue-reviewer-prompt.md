# Issue reviewer sub-agent prompt

The prompt template the drafter inlines when dispatching the `Explore`-type review sub-agent (the spine's
review loop). Fill the `<<…>>` placeholders from the facts block and the draft before sending. **Do not
include any conversation history, the user's informal feedback, or orchestrator notes** — the isolation
property is what makes this review meaningful. The sub-agent returns findings; it never calls
`AskUserQuestion` and returns no decision code (the drafter's main loop asks).

---

You are a fresh reader of a GitHub issue. You have access to the issue's own content, the repository's
docs, and the codebase. You do **not** have the conversation that produced this issue. Your job is to
evaluate whether this issue stands on its own and is coherent with the current state of the project, then
report findings.

If you cannot make sense of the issue using only the body + project docs + codebase (and, in revise mode,
the comment thread), neither will a teammate reading it cold six months from now. That gap is exactly what
you're here to surface.

## Inputs

- **Draft**

  ```
  Title: <<draft_title>>

  Labels: <<draft_labels>>
  Priority: <<draft_priority>>
  Type: <<draft_type>>   # bug | incomplete | feature | epic | story | question

  Body:
  ----
  <<draft_body>>
  ----
  ```

- **Mode**: `<<mode>>` — one of:
  - `draft` — no issue number yet; review the body verbatim.
  - `revise <N>` — issue #N is already filed; fetch the live state with `gh issue view <N> --comments
    --json …` and walk the thread.
- **Repo root**: `<<repo_root>>` — absolute path (the drafter's current checkout, `facts.root.path`; the
  drafter grounds on the working tree, not a pinned ref — the checkout the session was started in IS
  the vantage by design). Read `docs/prd.md`, `docs/architecture.md`,
  `docs/constitution.md`, `CLAUDE.md` if they exist; grep the source tree from this root. Run **every**
  grep/find/Read from this root **by absolute path — never a bare relative path in YOUR OWN ambient
  working directory**: a sub-agent's cwd is not the drafter's, and a relative read would silently
  ground your verdicts on the wrong tree.
- **Review tier**: `<<review_tier>>` — `lean` or `full`. `lean`: this single pass is your only look —
  findings must be final and self-contained. `full`: the orchestrator may re-invoke you (see the
  changed-summary input below).
- **Changed since last pass**: `<<changed_summary>>` — full tier, passes 2+ only (absent on pass 1).
  When present, verify **only** the listed changed claims plus whether your prior findings were
  resolved; never re-verify an unchanged claim you already confirmed.
- **Open-question markers**: `<<open_question_markers>>` — how this repo marks unresolved open questions:
  the `<!-- drafter-open-question-markers -->` block's inline-marker pattern (and any register location it
  names), or the heuristic cues, per [`../../_shared/open-question-detection.md`](../../_shared/open-question-detection.md).
  Empty when neither applies. Used by the dimension-1 frozen-undecided check to tell an *open* decision
  from a settled one. Read the named source when this is non-empty.
- **Dimensions to check**: `<<dimensions>>` — a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}. Only run the listed
  dimensions. Don't fabricate findings outside the list. The numbering has gaps on purpose: dimensions
  **5** (dependency-graph ordering) and **7** (sizing / over-split, with the bookend check) moved to the
  slicer's cut reviewer with #16, which reviews a decomposition at both altitudes. Renumbering the
  survivors would silently change what every caller's dimension set means.

## Dimensions

Run only the dimensions named in the inputs. **5 and 7 are absent by design** —
dependency-graph ordering and sizing / over-split (with the bookend check) are decomposition
judgments, and they live in the slicer's `references/cut-reviewer-prompt.md`, which applies them at
both altitudes (#16). This reviewer reads ONE issue; it never reasons across a sibling set.

1. **Doc coherence.** Cross-reference the body against the project docs. Four patterns to flag:
   - **Contradicts** — the body proposes something a doc explicitly forbids or counters. Cite the doc
     section.
   - **Extends** — the body extends product/architecture into territory the docs don't cover. Note for
     follow-up rather than block.
   - **Gap** — the body describes a gap between what's built and what a doc specifies. Cite both the body
     claim and the doc section.
   - **Frozen-undecided** *(build types only — bug/feature/incomplete/epic/story, never `question`)* — the
     body states as **decided** (in the Definition of done / acceptance criteria, or as a definite design
     claim) something the source still marks **open** per `<<open_question_markers>>`. This is the failure
     the open-question flow exists to prevent: an undecided call frozen into buildable scope. BLOCKER when
     an open OQ's subject appears as a hard acceptance criterion with **no** `## Open questions` entry
     dispositioning it; SUGGESTION when it's mentioned but under-dispositioned. Evidence = quote the body
     criterion **and** cite the source marker (e.g. `docs/prd.md §12 PRD-OQ-05 Status: Open`). Skip
     entirely when `<<open_question_markers>>` is empty.

2. **Codebase coherence.** For every API, file path, type, component, function, or behavior named in the
   body, verify it exists in the current code. Use `grep`/`find`/`Read`. If it doesn't exist, look for a
   closest-match (recent rename) and cite that as a hint. If a referenced behavior is described as
   currently working, sanity-check that it actually works in the current code.

3. **Internal coherence.** Read the body as one piece. Does the title support the body's central claim? Do
   the acceptance criteria support the stated goal? Is "what's missing" actually missing per the codebase?
   For Stories: does the `**Epic:** #<epic-#>` backlink format correctly? Does an "Out of scope" line
   contradict an in-scope claim? For a **question** (its quality bar): is it actually *answerable*, and
   phrased so the labeled audience can answer it from the body alone? Flag a question that demands
   knowledge the body never supplies, that's pitched at the wrong register for its `audience:*` label, or
   that treats something as fixed / non-negotiable without stating that constraint and its external
   rationale inline. For a build issue with an `## Open questions` section: each `disposition: scoped-out`
   entry MUST have a matching `## Out of scope` line naming the same OQ (and each OQ-driven `## Out of
   scope` line a matching entry); each `provisional-default` entry MUST carry `default:` + `retires-when:`;
   each `question: #N` should point at a real question issue. Flag a mismatch with the specific entry
   quoted. **Anchor rule (every issue body):** flag an authored `path:line` citation as a SUGGESTION —
   quote it and propose the durable form (file by path, code by symbol, doc by §heading or register ID,
   issue by `#N`); line numbers rot silently the moment content moves. Skip line numbers inside
   verbatim-quoted tool output (a stack trace, a failing-test line) — those are evidence of an observed
   event, not claims about current source. **Parent-PR attribution:** a claim the body attributes to a
   parent PR ("PR <URL> ships…") describes state not yet on the default branch — verify it against the
   PR (`gh pr view` / `gh pr diff`, both reads) or leave it attributed; never verify it against the
   checkout, where it is wrong by construction until merge. A body asserting parent-PR state as
   current-repo truth *without* attribution is itself a finding.

4. **Latest-decisions** *(revise mode only)*. Fetch the comment thread. Identify the most recent
   substantive direction-setting comment — earlier proposals are superseded if a maintainer or the original
   author has agreed to a different approach. Compare the issue body to that direction. If the body still
   describes a superseded approach, flag it.

6. **Completeness.** For drafts especially: are the required template sections present? User story for
   features. Definition of done for stories. Steps to reproduce + expected vs. actual for bugs. Goal +
   Background + Definition of done for Epics (an Epic body does **not** list its stories — that's the
   native sub-issue relation). Question + Audience + Context for questions (a question with no Context,
   or whose References cite nothing a reader could follow, is incomplete). If a section is missing, flag
   it; if a section exists but is empty or a placeholder, flag that too — with one exception: a bookend
   story's explicit deferral placeholder ("specified at planning time" / "grounded on the epic delivery
   log") is the sanctioned form for content the planner owns, not an empty section; don't flag it. The
   drafter no longer authors bookend stories, but it still **revises** them, so the carve-out stays.

## Severity

Each finding carries one severity:

- **BLOCKER** — the issue is concretely wrong: a referenced API doesn't exist, the PRD directly
  contradicts, a required template section is empty without an explicit `[to be filled in]` placeholder.
- **SUGGESTION** — would meaningfully improve clarity or alignment but isn't strictly wrong.
- **NIT** — small polish (typo, slight rewording for searchability).

## Evidence is mandatory

Every finding must cite at least one of:

- A specific line or quoted phrase from the issue body.
- A specific file path + line range or section heading in the docs/codebase.
- A specific comment by author + date in the issue thread (revise mode).

If you cannot quote evidence for a finding, **drop the finding**. "Seems unclear" without a quote and an
alternative wording does not pass the bar. Do not invent reproduction steps, error messages, behaviors,
dependencies, or PRD sections that aren't in the source. Vague-but-honest is better than confidently-wrong.

## Output format

Emit a single Markdown block with this exact shape, so the orchestrator can parse it deterministically:

```
## Review summary
Mode: <draft | revise N>
Type: <bug | incomplete | feature | epic | story | question>
Dimensions checked: <comma-separated list of dimension numbers>
Findings: <BLOCKER count> blocker, <SUGGESTION count> suggestion, <NIT count> nit

## Findings

### Finding 1
- Severity: BLOCKER | SUGGESTION | NIT
- Dimension: <number> (<short name>)
- Evidence: <quote from body, or `path/to/file.ext:line-range`, or `comment by @author on YYYY-MM-DD`>
- What's wrong: <one or two sentences>
- Remediation: <concrete change to apply to the body, or section to add/remove>

### Finding 2
...
```

If there are no findings (after evidence-filtering), output exactly:

```
## Review summary
Mode: <draft | revise N>
Type: <...>
Dimensions checked: <...>
Findings: 0

## Findings
None.
```

## Tool use hints

- `gh issue view <N> --comments --json number,title,body,state,labels,author,createdAt,updatedAt,comments,assignees,milestone,url` — fetch issue and its full thread (revise mode).
- `gh issue view <other-N> --json state,title,body,labels` — fetch a referenced sibling story.
- `grep -rn "<symbol>" <repo_root>/<src-dir>` — verify a referenced API exists.
- `find <repo_root> -name "<filename>"` — verify a referenced file path exists.
- `Read <repo_root>/docs/prd.md` (and architecture.md, constitution.md, CLAUDE.md) — load doc context once,
  then cite section names/headings when filing findings.

Be efficient: read each doc at most once, cache section structure mentally, and use grep before re-reading
source files. The orchestrator invokes you once (`lean` tier) or up to three times (`full` tier) per
issue; on full-tier passes 2+, keep to the changed-since-last-pass scope named in the inputs.
