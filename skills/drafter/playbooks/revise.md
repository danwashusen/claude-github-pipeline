# Revise an existing issue

Route for a **revise** session on a standalone issue or a story (`vector.mode: revise`, `vector.type` ≠
`question`; `vector.type: epic` routes to `epic-split.md` instead). Refresh a stale issue against today's
reality without re-filing: start from the filed body, end in `edit-body`.

## Step R1 — Read the target

Read the issue body + full thread from `facts.sections` (spilled paths) and `facts.target`. The
plan-marker facts (`facts.revise.plan`), the open-PR list (`facts.revise.open_prs`), and the closed-by-PR
/ project references (`facts.revise.*`) are already in the facts block — surface an in-flight PR before
editing so the user can coordinate. `facts.attention` flags a **closed** target: resolve the closed-issue
gate first (`header: "Closed issue"`): **Revise as-is** / **Reopen first** / **File follow-up**.

## Step R2 — Confirm the latest direction

Long threads matter: the substantive direction-setting may be several comments down and may supersede the
original body. Write a one-line state summary the user can correct before any work begins (freeform, not a
card): "Original body says X; @maintainer on <date> agreed to W — I'll revise toward W. Correct?" Don't
re-litigate decided questions.

## Step R3 — Run the spine

Read [`draft-spine.md`](draft-spine.md) and execute it (resolve open questions → draft the revised body →
review → confirm → apply). The deltas this route supplies:

- **Reviewer dimensions.** `1, 2, 3, 6` **plus 4** (`revise <N>` mode — the sub-agent fetches live state
  and walks the thread under the latest-decisions dimension).
- **Open-question reconciliation.** Re-run detection against the current source and the issue's existing
  `## Open questions`. Add entries for newly-opened OQs (match first). For an OQ whose companion is now
  **resolved** — read via the tiered status read (a `closed` question **or** a `<!-- question-decision:v1 -->`
  comment; else the question-status reader), per
  [`../../_shared/open-question-links.md`](../../_shared/open-question-links.md) — surface it in the diff
  (its scoped-out part can re-file later; any native `blocked by` removed via `gh_persist.py link <repo>
  <issue> --remove-blocked-by #N`) rather than silently deleting the entry. The drafter reconciles the
  section; it never resolves the OQ.
- **Diff-show, not a repaint.** Show only what changes (Title old→new; Labels ±; changed/added/removed
  body sections); "(other sections unchanged)" for the rest. Wait for **explicit** confirmation (freeform
  prose gate — a diff, not a fresh draft card).
- **Preserve the plan pointer.** Keep any `> 📋 **Implementation plan:**` pointer line verbatim in the
  revised body — don't drop, duplicate, or touch the `<!-- implementation-plan:v1 -->` comment it links to.

## Step R4 — Apply

Stage the full revised body (plan pointer preserved) to `<facts.scratch>/revised.md` and apply the deltas:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh_persist.py edit-body <owner/repo> <N> "<facts.scratch>/revised.md"
```

Label changes are a separate `gh_persist.py edit-labels <owner/repo> <N> --add … --remove …`. If the
revision materially changed scope / acceptance criteria / contracts the plan was built against, tell the
user once after applying: the plan on #N may now be stale — re-run `/github-pipeline:planner` in revise
mode. The drafter never edits the plan.

**Story special case.** Verify the `**Epic:** #<epic-#>` backlink still points at an **open** Epic. If the
Epic has closed, gate (`header: "Epic closed"`): **Close the story** / **Detach backlink** / **Relink to
epic** — don't leave a Story dangling under a closed Epic.

## Handoff

Read [`../references/handoff-renderings.md`](../references/handoff-renderings.md) immediately before
composing this and emit the matching shape verbatim — copy it, substitute only the data below, never
rename a field or restructure it. Match on whether a
plan exists (`facts.revise.plan.present`) and whether the revise was material:

- **No plan yet** (`plan: ✗`) → forward to the planner to author one.
- **Plan exists, material revise** → `plan: stale`; forward to the planner in revise mode to refresh it;
  `Why:` cites the specific scope/AC/contract change.
- **Plan exists, cosmetic revise** → plan stays current; terminal or resolver-ready depending on whether a
  PR is already in flight.
- Add the `**Open questions:**` line whenever the revised body carries an `## Open questions` section.
