# Polish adjudication (spine S5.5)

The evaluator proposes, and the operator decides, what happens to the PR's `## Polish` ledger entries
still undecided when the PR reaches it. Format, dispositions and ownership live in
[`../../_shared/polish-ledger.md`](../../_shared/polish-ledger.md); the steps the evaluator shares with
the resolver — re-check each claim at head, propose, group, the `Polish` card, record the answers — live
in [`../../_shared/polish-triage.md`](../../_shared/polish-triage.md); this file is the evaluator's part.
It runs **after the S5 verdict and before S7's post timing**, because under an `auto` merge policy an
APPROVE posts and merges immediately — a ledger decided after that point could not stop the merge.

This step is the **backstop**. The resolver's finalisation (`resolver/references/finalisation.md`)
already put every entry its final pass left to the operator, before the push, so a decided entry —
`file`, `drop`, `applied`, or `apply` — is the operator's answer and is never asked about again here,
except the unfixed `apply` below. An `open` entry reaching this step is one finalisation left undecided:
an operator's "leave for the evaluator" answer, polish its light re-review found, or a PR opened before
finalisation existed.

Input: `facts.polish` (prep's scan of the PR body), plus `facts.plans` and `facts.dod` for the scope and
decision checks. Nothing to do when it is absent or carries no `open`, unfixed `apply`, or `file` entry.
A line in `facts.polish.unparsed` is rewritten into grammar by this step's write, keeping its text;
never silently dropped.

## 1. Re-check each entry at head and propose a disposition

First, every entry still marked `apply` — confirmed on an earlier run or at the resolver's finalisation,
but left unfixed (an **Accept current** on its stall card, an abort). Still present at head → propose
`apply` again and put it back in front of the operator at §2, marked
`confirmed on a prior run, left unfixed`: skipping it would silently drop the operator's decision, and
forcing it with no card would leave no way to release it once priorities change — the operator may
re-apply, file it instead, or drop it. Gone at head → `drop` with the note
`resolved otherwise at <short-sha>`. Next, every `file` entry — decided on an earlier run whose verdict
sent the PR back, or at the resolver's finalisation, so still unfiled (filing runs only after the merge),
and a later commit may have fixed it: still true at head → keep it, not asked again; gone → `drop` with
`resolved otherwise at <short-sha>`, named in the review. Then the `open` entries: run
[`../../_shared/polish-triage.md`](../../_shared/polish-triage.md) §1–§2 in the workspace
(`facts.workspace.path`, at `pr.headRefOid`), the plan from `facts.plans`, with the evaluator's apply bar:

- **`apply`** — the polish would be **actively bad to merge**: it meets
  [`../../_shared/polish-ledger.md`](../../_shared/polish-ledger.md) "Apply criteria". This bucket is
  meant to be near-empty: the resolver fixes polish matching those criteria in-loop and never ledgers it
  (`review-fix-round.md` "Classification rubric"), so an
  `apply`-criteria entry here is a **resolver miss** — name it as one in the review body. Applying here
  costs a whole resolver session, which is why finalisation asks the operator first; propose `file` for
  anything that is merely worth doing.

An entry that turns out to be a real defect is not polish: it is a dimension failure in S4 (soft-reject
on the evidence), and the entry is `drop`ped with the note `reclassified: defect — see review`.

## 2. Decide the ledger with the operator

The evaluator **proposes**; the operator decides **every** entry §1 proposed a disposition for — `file`
and `drop` included, on any verdict and under either merge policy, `auto` and epic-integration alike.
The ledger is where the resolver parked what it would not fix, so what happens to it is the operator's
call, not the evaluator's alone — asking only about `apply` left a ledger of `file` / `drop` entries as
one line of the approval question, with no way to re-plan an entry. Ask **before** the S7-gate
`Approve PR` card and before any S7-post, so the gate and the review see the final dispositions.

Group, ask and record the answers per [`../../_shared/polish-triage.md`](../../_shared/polish-triage.md)
§3–§4. A re-proposed `apply` joins its seam's group and says it was
`confirmed on a prior run, left unfixed`.

With no **Apply in this PR** or **Re-plan** answer, the verdict stands and S7 proceeds — under `ask` to
the `Approve PR` card, which does not carry the ledger. With one, an APPROVE becomes COMMENT (§4). On a
verdict that is **already** COMMENT — the evaluator's own soft-reject (red health, a failed dimension, an
S4-untick) — the answers decide only which items go back with the PR: the review keeps the evaluator's
header and the `COMMENT (soft-reject)` marker, and the route is the verdict's own, except that a
**Re-plan** answer routes to `planner revise` as an S4-untick does. This card is the **only** limit on
how often a PR goes back for polish — deliberately an operator decision, not a counter; do not add one.

## 3. Write the dispositions once

After the last `Polish` card is answered, and before the review posts, rewrite the `## Polish` section
with the final dispositions — the ledger never records a decision the operator overrode. Stage the whole
PR body with the rewritten section to `<facts.scratch>/pr-body-polish.md` and apply it through the single
write path (`edit-pr-body` — the issue-body op `edit-body` rejects a PR number):

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh_persist.py edit-pr-body <owner/repo> <PR> \
  "<facts.scratch>/pr-body-polish.md"
```

Entries are never deleted (`polish-ledger.md` "Rules").

## 4. A confirmed `apply` — the soft-reject and its route

The review body gains a `## Polish` section listing each `apply` entry by id with its reason. When the
polish answer is what turned an APPROVE into COMMENT, the body also takes the operator-attribution header
(`**Operator decision: Needs Revision**`, per `review-comment.md`) since the operator made the call; on an
already-COMMENT verdict it keeps the evaluator's own (§2). Post it as S7-post's `comment` and flip the PR back to draft exactly as a
COMMENT verdict does. The handoff's `review:` marker is `COMMENT (operator: needs-revision)` — or
`COMMENT (soft-reject)` on an already-COMMENT verdict.

Route by whether applying the items changes the plan — the same test the resolver's fix plan applies to
a fix that reverses a plan decision:

- **Changes the plan** — the operator answered **Re-plan** on any entry, or applying an item would
  reverse a `## Architecture decisions` / `## UI decisions` bullet, add or reshape a phase's scope, or
  cross an epic's `## Story contracts` → **`/github-pipeline:planner revise #<issue>`**. The planner sees
  the ledger (`facts.revise.open_pr.polish`) and absorbs the `apply` items as a new phase; the resolver
  then builds it in continue mode.
- **Otherwise** → **`/github-pipeline:resolver #<issue>`**. The resolver's revision run treats every
  `apply` entry as Addressable whatever its tier and marks it `applied (commit <sha>)` once fixed.
