# Follow-up filing — drafter-proxy sub-agent protocol

The single execution path for *creating* a follow-up issue from the **resolver** (its review-loop and
end-of-build checkpoint), the **evaluator** (its post-merge residual-filing step), or the **planner**
(a seam disposition's follow-up — "contract only" / "own issue", filed before the plan posts so its
boundary bullets cite real issue numbers). All file the same way: no hand-crafted `gh issue create`
bodies — every follow-up routes through the `drafter` (PRD-grounded, sub-agent-reviewed) via a
`general-purpose` sub-agent that proxy-confirms the draft and returns the URL. The caller keeps its own
registry / timing / URL-weaving rules; this file is only the filing round-trip they share.

## Protocol — sub-agent proxy-confirms via the drafter

For each item the caller's own gate has approved for filing (the resolver's user, the evaluator's
residual step, the planner's seam-disposition answer), spawn a `general-purpose` sub-agent with this
prompt (substitute the placeholders at call time):

```
You are filing one GitHub follow-up issue on behalf of the calling skill
(the resolver, the evaluator, or the planner). Invoke the
`/github-pipeline:drafter` skill, proxy-confirm the draft, and return the
filed issue URL.

Item to file:
- Type: <bug | incomplete-feature | feature | deferred-test | revise-existing>
- Title hint: <one-line summary>
- Description: <2–5 sentences: the finding, why it matters, and the
  judgment worth freezing — rulings, exemption classes, constraints.
  Durable anchors only (paths, symbols, doc section headings, register
  IDs, #N); never pasted grep output or path:line inventories —
  downstream skills re-derive sites fresh. If the item describes state
  the parent PR introduces that is not yet on the default branch, say so>
- Parent reference: PR <URL>, issue #<N>, epic #<E> (if applicable)
- Repository: <owner/repo>

Steps:

1. Invoke the drafter skill, passing the description above as
   the informal feedback. State the type hint, title hint, and parent
   reference clearly so the drafter has them at classification time, and
   state that this is a **proxy-filed follow-up (lean review)** — the
   drafter's lean tier: one review pass, suggestions surfaced unapplied
   at its gate. Also relay the attribution rule: any claim describing
   what the parent PR introduces (state not yet on the default branch)
   must be attributed to the PR in the body ("PR <URL> ships…"), never
   asserted as current-repo truth.

2. The drafter validates the draft with its single lean review pass
   (against the project's PRD, architecture, constitution, and current
   code state). Suggestions it surfaces unapplied at its gate are
   informational — approve on step 3's checks alone (you may note them
   in your return); don't add review rounds of your own.

3. The drafter will reach its user-confirmation gate ("Show the draft
   and wait for confirmation" — nothing is filed before it). You act as
   the user at this gate.
   Run three checks:

   a. Type — does the drafter's chosen type match the hint? If the drafter
      decided differently (e.g., classified as `incomplete-feature` when
      you hinted `bug`), accept the drafter's call IF its rationale is
      sound. The drafter sees the description directly and may classify
      better than the hint; only override if the drafter has clearly
      misread the description.

   b. Parent reference — is the parent PR/issue/epic preserved in the
      body's Related-issues section? The drafter's bug, story, feature,
      and incomplete-feature formats all have this section. Without it
      the filed issue is orphaned. If missing, reply to the drafter:
      "Please add the parent reference (PR <URL>, parent issue #<N>) to
      the Related-issues section."

   c. Substance — does the body's What's-wrong / What's-missing /
      Definition-of-done content match the description? If the drafter
      hallucinated detail the description doesn't support, reply with a
      one-sentence correction.

4. Approve if all three checks pass. If any check fails, reply with the
   correction and let the drafter iterate. Cap at 2 correction rounds —
   if the third draft still fails any check, stop and return an error to
   the parent with the latest draft inline so the parent can decide.

5. After approval, the drafter files through its staged write path
   (`gh_persist.py create`, or `edit-body` in revise mode) and returns the
   URL. Capture that URL.

Return only:
- The filed URL (or "error: <reason>" if you stopped at step 4's cap)
- The drafter's final type (in case it overrode the hint)
- A one-line note if you raised any correction before approving

Do NOT file an issue yourself with `gh issue create`. The drafter does
this inside its own flow. Your role is to invoke, proxy-confirm, return.
```

The sub-agent isolates the drafter's verbose work (PRD reading, classification questioning, nested
sub-agent review loop) from the caller's main context. The caller sees one round-trip per item: input
brief → output URL.
