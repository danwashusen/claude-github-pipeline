# targeted — the questions are given

The planner (or the operator) hit a specific knowledge gap and named the question(s) on the trigger
(`— <question>`), so `facts.vector.questions` carries them. Skip the derivation and the confirm gate —
the questions are already settled — and run the shared spine. Read
[`research-spine.md`](research-spine.md) and run it end to end after this front-end.

## Identify and discover

Prep fetched the issue and thread. `Read` the body and thread from `facts.sections`
(`issue_body*`/`thread*`) for context. **Discover the stack:** `Read` the manifests and docs
`facts.inventory` lists (`manifests.files`/`docs.files`) — the manifests' **pinned versions** are the
currency signal you filter the given questions against. If a pin you need isn't there (`manifests.present`
false, or the version absent), grep the tree rather than assume none. Write a one-line **stack context**
summary (verbatim into the dossier). Discover it fresh; assume no ecosystem before this.

## Take the given questions

Research exactly the questions in `facts.vector.questions` — do **not** re-derive or expand the set, and
do **not** run the decline gate (the gap that routed here is real by construction; the operator already
decided there is something to research). If a given question is a *design* question rather than external
truth ("which pattern should we use?"), that is the one thing to flag back — it's the planner's call, not
research — rather than manufacturing a dossier around it.

## Run the spine

Run [`research-spine.md`](research-spine.md) end to end (gather → synthesize → validate → persist →
handoff). `facts.revise` is absent, so the persist is a fresh post (no `--delete-marker-id`) and the
handoff carries the new dossier's URL with `research: ✓`; the `Why:` quotes the specific gap the research
closed so the re-run planner can act without re-investigating.
