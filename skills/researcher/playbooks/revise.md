# revise — refresh an existing dossier

An `<!-- issue-research:v1 -->` dossier already exists on the issue (`facts.revise` present). Refresh
what changed — re-fetch sources that may have moved, re-date claims, answer new questions — and
delete-and-repost. **Never** re-research untouched sections from scratch. Read
[`research-spine.md`](research-spine.md) and run it end to end after this front-end.

## Identify and read the prior dossier

Prep fetched the issue, thread, and the existing dossier. `Read` the body and thread from `facts.sections`
(`issue_body*`/`thread*`), and `Read` the prior dossier from `facts.revise.dossier` (`body`/`body_path`).
Its `comment_id` is what the spine's persist deletes on delete-and-repost. Its `## Questions researched`
carry forward — don't re-derive them, and don't run the decline gate (the dossier's existence already
settled that there is research here). A `— <question>` on the trigger (`facts.vector.questions`) narrows
the refresh to that specific gap.

## Discover the current stack

`Read` the manifests and docs `facts.inventory` lists (`manifests.files`/`docs.files`) — a version pin
may have **moved** since the prior run, which is exactly the kind of change a refresh exists to catch. If
a pin you need isn't there (`manifests.present` false, or the version absent), grep the tree rather than
assume none. Update the one-line **stack context** summary if it changed.

## Refresh what changed, then run the spine

Determine what actually moved (a bumped dependency version, a new thread question, a source that may have
been revised) and refresh only those parts of the dossier; carry every unchanged, still-current finding
forward verbatim. Then run [`research-spine.md`](research-spine.md) end to end. Because `facts.revise` is
present, the spine shows the user a **diff** (not the full body), and its persist passes
`--delete-marker-id <facts.revise.dossier.comment_id>` so the new comment posts **before** the old one is
deleted. The handoff carries the *new* dossier URL with `research: ✓`; the `Why:` names what the refresh
changed.
