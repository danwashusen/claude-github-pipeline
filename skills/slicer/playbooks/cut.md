# cut — ground, decompose, review, approve, file

The one flow: (promote) → ground → decompose → adversarial review → approve → the write gate →
sequential filing → handoff. Both altitudes and both modes run these same steps and differ only in
values: `facts.vector.altitude` sets the bar and the child template, `facts.children` holds what exists,
`next_index` is where story-altitude numbering continues. Facts come from prep (SKILL.md §1); the write
discipline, the zero-mutation gate, the never-edit-the-parent rule, the review-loop control and the
partial-failure rule are SKILL.md §3, not restated here.

## S0 — Promote (only when `facts.promotion`)

The target is a standard issue the operator asked to become an Epic. Rewrite it **before** cutting, so the
rest of the session is an ordinary epic-altitude run. Draft the Epic body from the house Epic template
([`../../drafter/references/issue-templates.md`](../../drafter/references/issue-templates.md)), redistributing
#N's own content between it and the story bodies you propose (edit history preserves the original). A planner
seam-analysis comment pre-seeds the candidate story list — test it in S2, never authority.

This rewrite is destructive where a `create` is not, so it does **not** ride the cut's gate: diff-show the
old→new Title, Labels ±, and changed/added/removed sections, wait for **explicit confirmation**, then apply
all three. The new title takes the `Epic:` prefix — classification is **lexical**
([`../../_shared/epic-story-hierarchy.md`](../../_shared/epic-story-hierarchy.md): an issue with neither label
nor prefix reads as a non-epic), so skipping it half-promotes #N. Preserve any `> 📋 **Implementation plan:**`
pointer verbatim — the superseded plan comment is the planner's artifact, replaced by the Epic's re-plan. A
`## Stories` section is dropped: the native relation, not body text, is the story record.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh_persist.py edit-body <owner/repo> <N> "<facts.scratch>/epic.md"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh_persist.py edit-title <owner/repo> <N> --title "Epic: <confirmed title>"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh_persist.py edit-labels <owner/repo> <N> --add epic --remove <old-type>
```

On decline: perform none of the three writes, emit the *Declined at the promotion gate* shape, stop — an
unpromoted epic-altitude cut files stories under a non-epic parent, which the by-construction rule reads as
slices.

## S1 — Ground, or refuse

`Read` [`../references/slicing-method.md`](../references/slicing-method.md) first — the method, the
per-altitude child templates, and the presentation format this flow delegates to. Then read the target's
body and thread from `facts.sections` (spilled paths).

Read the docs `facts.grounding_docs` declares, from `facts.root.path` by absolute path — plain
`Read`/`Grep`. Treat each per its `role` (what it answers) and `authority`: `binding` = a cut that
contradicts it is wrong, not a trade-off; `informative` = context you weigh and cite. Skip and note an
entry whose `present` is false. If `facts.research.present`, also read the dossier — current external
truth the cut may cite, never authority.

**The grounding gate — the one gate that cannot degrade into proceeding.** No entries (or
`DOC_CATALOGUE_ABSENT` in `facts.notices`) **and** no sources the operator named at invocation: file
nothing, emit the *Refused — no grounding* shape, stop. If the operator did name sources, read those
and proceed.

## S2 — Decompose

Write the **decomposition strategy** first — two or three sentences: which seam carries the most risk,
what the walking skeleton is, what is deliberately deferred. It stays in this session; persisting it
parent-side would create a second source of truth about the child set, and each child's own rationale
section reconstructs the reasoning.

Cut per the method reference **at `facts.vector.altitude`**: walking skeleton first; each subsequent
child adds exactly one observable increment; every child clears its bar in one sentence; prefer few,
thick-enough children. At epic altitude also apply the coalescing pass and the two bookend slots (method
§5) — an omitted bookend is recorded with its reason in the epic body's `## Background` (an approved S4
row, never a silent write and never a silent omission). On `mode: resume` treat `facts.children` as fixed
— already approved, possibly already shipped — and cut only the remainder, numbering from
`facts.children.next_index` at story altitude. `facts.children.placeholder_count` entries are the
exception: a legacy `## Stories` bullet with no issue number names a story nobody has **filed**, so it is
part of what this cut files, not part of what it treats as done.

Include any `facts.adoption_candidates` as candidate children, marked as adoptions with their live state;
adopt an existing issue *instead of* filing a new child whose scope it already covers, never both. For a
candidate the operator names now, run the one-shot `--adopt-check` (SKILL.md §1).

**Citation duty.** Every child's grounding names what it derives from: the catalogue docs (with §refs)
recording the behaviour, the issue body/thread, the dossier. A child that can cite nothing is a gap in the
source or invented scope — surface it as a finding and leave it out of the cut. Carry any
`provisional-default` marker from `facts.open_questions` into the grounding of every child it touches.

## S3 — Review adversarially

Dispatch [`../references/cut-reviewer-prompt.md`](../references/cut-reviewer-prompt.md) (resolve its
absolute path yourself — a reference path is not substituted in a dispatched prompt). Fill `<<altitude>>`,
the parent (staging its body to `facts.scratch` and passing the **path**), the ordered candidates, any
existing children, `facts.grounding_docs`, and `facts.root.path` as `<<repo_root>>`. Run the **split
pass** (`<<pass>>: split`, dimensions `ordering, sizing`) on titles-plus-scopes, then the **re-confirm
pass** (`<<pass>>: re-confirm`, dimensions `ordering, sizing, conformance`) once bodies exist — a body
can reveal a child is bigger or smaller than its scope claimed. On passes 2+ also fill
`<<changed_summary>>` with what changed since the last pass, so the reviewer re-verifies only that plus
its own prior findings instead of re-reading the whole cut.

Apply the merges, splits and re-orders the findings justify; contest one you can refute with evidence and
say so. Re-loop under SKILL.md §3's control (3-pass cap, circular guard). A BLOCKER you neither fix nor
refute goes to the operator in S4's closing note — never silently past it.

## S4 — Present, iterate, and the write gate

Show the operator, per the method reference's presentation format: the grounding summary (one line per
doc read or noted absent), the strategy (and what coalescing merged, at epic altitude), the ordered child
list (designator-or-title + outcome sentence each, adoptions marked), the full proposed bodies, then a
closing note of risks, assumptions, unresolved reviewer findings, and anything wanting stakeholder
clarification. They may approve, re-cut, reorder, retitle, or drop children — iterate until approved. An
open question surfacing here is **not** a child: route it out (`/github-pipeline:drafter` files the
companion `question` issue) rather than burying a decision in a child body.

Then one summary table — designator-or-title · title · one-line outcome · the pending write (`create
--parent` for a new child, `add-parent` for an adoption, `edit-body` for a checklist reconciliation or a
bookend-omission `## Background` note) — and **one** explicit `AskUserQuestion` gate (per
[`../../_shared/asking-the-user.md`](../../_shared/asking-the-user.md)). Aborting here costs nothing; on
decline perform no writes and emit the *Declined at the write gate* shape (the proposed cut is in the
transcript; a re-run re-derives it).

## S5 — File the approved children

Stage each body to `<facts.scratch>/` — `slice-S<K>.md` at story altitude, `story-<i>.md` at epic
altitude — then apply the approved list **one at a time, in approved order**, interleaving creates and
adoptions exactly as approved:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh_persist.py create <owner/repo> "<facts.scratch>/slice-S<K>.md" \
  --title "<N>/S<K> — <behaviour phrase>" --parent <N>
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh_persist.py create <owner/repo> "<facts.scratch>/story-<i>.md" \
  --title "<story title>" --label story --parent <N>
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh_persist.py add-parent <owner/repo> <adopted-#> <N>
```

A `create` envelope returns the new issue's `url`, not its number — parse `#<n>` from the URL's trailing
segment for the report and the handoff. `add-parent` reports `changed`; an adopted issue's body is never
rewritten here.

At epic altitude, an **omitted bookend** approved at S4 lands as its `## Background` note in the same
`edit-body` that reconciles the checklist when both apply, or its own otherwise. It goes in the epic body
rather than this session's report because the reviewer re-reads it on every later resume to judge whether
the justification still holds; a session-only note would be gone by then.

When `facts.children.source` is `checklist` or `mixed`, the epic's legacy `## Stories` section is still
the only record of those entries: reconcile its checkboxes against live state (closed → checked, open →
unchecked) with **one** `edit-body`, and leave the section in place. `facts.attention` already names each
mismatch. This is the second sanctioned parent-body write, and it was approved at S4 like any other row.

A `SUBISSUES_UNSUPPORTED` notice means the relation was not established, so that child is **unparented**:
stop, report it, file no more. An unparented child drives no rollup — the entire reason these are issues —
so prose-linked children are worse than none: they read as tracked progress that does not exist.

## S6 — Handoff

Emit the matching shape from [`../references/handoff-renderings.md`](../references/handoff-renderings.md)
verbatim, per SKILL.md §4. The forward route is the planner: its phases must map onto the children just
filed (`sub-issue:` in [`../../planner/references/plan-schema.md`](../../planner/references/plan-schema.md)),
and its reconciliation reads the live set — so a plan authored before this cut is now stale. At epic
altitude the planner posts the epic-level plan (cross-story contracts + sequencing) and each story is
then planned just-in-time as it is built.
