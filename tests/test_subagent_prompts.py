"""Drift-check validator for v2 judgment sub-agent prompts (docs/implementation.md S11).

One typed-exception vocabulary spans scripts *and* judgment sub-agents: architecture.md §3's
**closed decision-code set** (which supersedes v1's `skills/_shared/subagent-decision-signal.md`).
This validator is the committed guard that keeps every v2 sub-agent prompt on that one vocabulary —
and it **binds later prompt authors** (S13 planner, S15 drafter, S16 researcher, S18 question pair,
S19 doc-reviewer): their prompts are auto-discovered the moment their v2 skill dir lands, so a new
prompt that names an off-§3 decision code, or that re-cites the retired signal doc, fails this test.

Three assertions, over every discovered v2 sub-agent prompt:

1. **Codes ⊆ §3.** The typed decision codes a prompt names as returnable (via the shared
   `## Exception` / `code:` protocol, plus any decision-code-shaped backticked token) must all be
   members of the §3 closed set. A prompt that returns no §3 code (a reviewer that returns findings,
   the test-selection sub-agent's `COMMAND:`/`RATIONALE:`, the review-loop's own richer
   `decision_request` card whose lowercase `kind`s are a *separate* protocol, never a §3 code) is
   vacuously conformant.
2. **No retired-doc citation.** No v2 prompt cites `subagent-decision-signal` — §3 supersedes it.
3. **No ref-arithmetic input.** No v2 prompt runs ref arithmetic (`git show <ref>:<path>` /
   `git grep <ref>`) inside a code fence — sub-agents read prep-staged paths / read workspaces, never
   a ref (architecture.md §6/§8). Reuses S10's fence-scoped ref-arithmetic patterns
   (`test_resolver_routing.py::ContractTokenGateTests`), so prose that *describes* the banned form
   (an audit note explaining what v1's ref reads were replaced with) doesn't false-positive.

Discovery keys on the v2 router+playbook anatomy (architecture.md §9): a skill dir carrying a
`playbooks/` subdirectory. While v1 and v2 coexisted this also excluded every frozen v1 skill dir
(none had `playbooks/`), so their still-v1 prompts could legitimately cite the retired doc until
their own cutover step. S20 removed the last of them, so the glob now discovers exactly the nine v2
skills' prompts — and keeps discovering any prompt a future skill adds.

The §3 code set is parsed from `docs/architecture.md` (anchored on the `## §3` heading, backticked
codes lifted from the closed-set list) — resilient to prose edits, strict on the set.
