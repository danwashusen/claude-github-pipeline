"""Routing / structural gates for the `slicer` skill (#17).

Prose has no compiler, so these are it. The suite mirrors the house set every
`tests/test_<skill>_routing.py` carries — frontmatter pins, routing-table ↔ disk ↔ prep agreement,
the structural bars, fence-scoped grep bans, `--dry-run` persist envelopes, handoff-rendering pins —
plus the gates specific to this stage:

  - **The write-gate posture.** "Zero GitHub mutations before the one gate" is the invariant that
    makes the stage safe to abort; it must be stated in the loaded prompt, not only in a reference.
  - **The refusal set is closed and matches prep.** The router names exactly the tokens
    `prep_slicer` can emit — a router that renders a refusal prep never produces, or misses one prep
    does, is a silent dead end.
  - **Never slice a slice, and never edit the parent body.** Both are load-bearing: the first keeps
    the by-construction slice identification sound, the second keeps the rollup the single source of
    truth about the slice set.

## The line bar

There is no v1 slicer, so prd.md §10's "half the v1 `SKILL.md` line count" has no input. `SLICER_BAR`
is **measured, not halved** — see the constant's comment below for the derivation.

# MEASURED, not halved. prd.md §10's formula ("router + the one playbook <= half the v1 SKILL.md line
# count") has no input here: there was never a v1 slicer, and the working prototype this stage is
# based on (a repo-local skill: 284-line SKILL.md + a 179-line method reference) is ALREADY split
# router/reference, so halving it would double-count a compression that already happened.
#
# ORIGINAL DERIVATION (#17, one altitude): the prototype's generic core is 284 lines minus ~85 lines
# of repo-local board mechanics and ~15 lines of local worked example, i.e. ~145-165 lines of loaded
# prompt. The plugin version dropped the remaining board half and added the four-section router
# anatomy, the facts block, the handoff section and the re-route arm — which roughly cancel. Hence
# 170, landed at exactly 170.
#
# RE-ADJUDICATED at #16 (170 -> 261), which retargeted the stage to a SECOND altitude and moved four
# behaviours here from the drafter's epic-split. Per prd.md §10 and the S19 doc-reviewer precedent,
# an honest implementation that exceeds a recorded bar is re-adjudicated and re-recorded — precision
# is never trimmed out of a prompt to hit a number. What the +91 lines buy, measured against the #17
# router (90) + cut.md (80):
#
#   +22  S0, the promotion prefix — a second write flow with its own diff-and-confirm gate, which the
#        cut's own zero-mutation gate deliberately does not cover.
#   +12  S3, the adversarial review loop + its invariant. #17 had no reviewer at all; dimensions 5
#        and 7 moved off the drafter's issue reviewer onto references/cut-reviewer-prompt.md.
#   +25  epic-altitude value plumbing: the altitude fact and its two bars, the per-altitude child
#        template branch, the bookend slots, and the legacy `## Stories` reconciliation write.
#   +20  adoption ("epic over existing issues"): the prep flags, candidates in S2, `add-parent` in
#        S5, and the sequential-creation invariant extended to cover it.
#   +12  router: the promote rule (the one thing only the router can decide), the rewritten refusal
#        set, and the added handoff fields.
#
# The router itself still fits one default Read (120 <= 150), which is the bar that actually protects
# session startup; the growth is in the playbook, loaded only on the routed path.
