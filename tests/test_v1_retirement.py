"""S20 DoD box 1, as a committed test: v1 is gone and nothing still points at it.

The plan's box-1 grep runs the retired-name literals — the seven v1 skill directory names, the
executor sub-agent, the hook-runner script — over `skills/ agents/ scripts/ tests/ README.md
.claude-plugin/ CLAUDE.md`. Those literals live in `tests/support/retired_tokens.py`
(`RETIRED_NAME_PATTERNS`), which is why this file never spells one: the token table is the single
place they are allowed to appear, so the scan below can hold every *other* file to zero.

`docs/specs/**` and `docs/implementation.md` are exempt as the historical record; `agents/` no
longer exists (its absence is itself asserted below). The scan here is that grep plus the precise
exemptions recorded in `tests/support/retired_tokens.py` — each licensing one *known* frozen string
in one file, never a token generally, so a fresh stale reference in an exempted file still fails.

Also asserted: no `*.sh` remains under `scripts/`, no v1 skill directory remains under `skills/`,
and the exemption list is live (every entry still matches something — a stale exemption is a hole).
