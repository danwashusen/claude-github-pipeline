"""Regression pin: every ``scripts/*.py`` CLI entry point is executable on disk.

Repo-wide, not setup-specific — lives at the top level of ``tests/`` (a neighbor of
``tests/test_run_py.py``, which is likewise about how the scripts get invoked rather than about one
skill's behavior) rather than under ``tests/test_setup_routing.py``, since the defect this pins is not
particular to the setup cutover.

**The Div-1 defect (docs/specs/parity/setup.md, S17 live parity, both legs).** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
invocations always call a script by its **bare path** (``${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/prep_setup.py
...``), never via ``python3 <script>``. A script with a shebang line but the executable bit unset
exits **126** (`Permission denied`) the moment the OS tries to exec it directly — a hard failure with
no Python traceback, since the interpreter never even starts. This is the **third recurrence** of the
same class of defect (the "S21-era chmod lesson"): `scripts/prep_setup.py` and `scripts/workspace.py`
shipped 0644 out of S17's implementor pass, and the orchestrator's own sweep caught a third,
`scripts/parse.py`, already 0644 before this step touched it. Both S17 live-parity legs hit the 126 and
self-recovered by falling back to an explicit `python3 <script>` invocation — an honest, undesirable
recovery this test exists to make impossible to reintroduce silently. Fixed by ``chmod +x`` on all
three (docs/specs/parity/setup.md's Div-1 annotation records the resolution); this test is the
mechanical guard so a future new script — or a future artifact-export step that silently drops the
executable bit (e.g. a naive ``git archive``/zip/tarball round-trip, or a fresh ``git clone`` on a
filesystem/umask that doesn't preserve it) — fails the offline suite instead of failing live at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` dispatch time.

**Scope of the pin.** Only a script that is BOTH (a) shebang-led (``#!...``, so it is meant to be
exec'd directly, not merely imported) AND (b) carries a top-level ``def main(`` CLI entry point (so it
is a real command, not a library module ``pipelib/*.py`` composes in-process) is required to be
executable. `scripts/oq_tracker.py` has a shebang but no ``def main(``/``__main__`` guard — a
composed-in-process helper module, not a directly-dispatched CLI — so it is outside this pin's scope
(it happens to already be executable; not asserted here, since it's not part of the closed-set
contract this test protects).
