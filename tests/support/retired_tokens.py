"""The v1 surfaces retired at S20, and the exemptions that survive them.

This module is the **single home for the retired token literals**. Every other file under the
S20 DoD's scanned paths (`skills/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `README.md`, `.claude-plugin/`,
`CLAUDE.md`) is held to zero hits for them by `tests/test_v1_retirement.py`, so the literals live
here once — imported by the per-skill routing gates and by the retirement scan itself — rather than
being retyped in a dozen regexes. `docs/specs/**` and `docs/implementation.md` are exempt as the
historical record (S20 DoD box 1).

Two token families:

1. `RETIRED_NAME_PATTERNS` — the S20 DoD box-1 grep set, verbatim: the seven v1 skill directory
   names, the `github-ops` executor sub-agent, and the `worktree-hooks` runner script. A hit is a
   stale reference to something that no longer exists on disk.
2. `FORBIDDEN_CONTRACT_TOKENS` — the per-skill prompt gate every cutover step (S7/S10/S13/S15–S19)
   applied to its own `skills/<name>/` tree: the executor name, the v1 skill-invocation namespace
   (`github-pipeline:github-*`), the `GATHER_*` / `PERSIST_*` op names, and the resolver-local
   `§P` IDs. All four retired with v1; this regex keeps them from creeping back.

**Exemptions** are (path, token, required-line-fragment) triples, so an exemption licenses one
*known* string in one file — never the token generally. Two classes:

- **Frozen artifact provenance** ([prd.md §7](../../docs/prd.md)). A persisted artifact's footer
  names the v1 skill that authored it (`_Authored by \\`github-issue-planner\\`…`, `_Cached by
  \\`github-pr-evaluator\\`…`). These are byte-compatibility contract tokens a cross-consuming v1
  reader matches verbatim — the S7 adjudication (a) recorded in `docs/specs/baseline.md` §5.3 — so
  the skill rename deliberately does **not** propagate into the artifact bytes. The exemption covers
  the rendering file *and* the test that pins those bytes.
- **Consuming-repo doc filename.** `docs/open-questions.md` is a *sandbox repo's* open-question
  register, not the retired `open-questions` skill. It is the false-positive the DoD's bare
  `open-questions` grep would otherwise trip on.
